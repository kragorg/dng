<h1 id="appendix-a-dramatis-personae">Appendix A — Dramatis
Personae</h1>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Adventurers</strong>: The primary group consisting of
<strong>Elara</strong>, <strong>Halite</strong>,
<strong>Kragor</strong>, <strong>Scarlet</strong>,
<strong>Whisper</strong>, <strong>Doctor Pepe</strong>, and
<strong>Gerhard</strong>. Having survived the perils of the sea and the
Foren wastes, they have breached the sunken Aeorian ruin of Salsvault.
Within its silent, geometric halls, they have battled arcane constructs,
a tide of zombies, and a giant octopus, all while piecing together the
ruin’s grim purpose. They now use a nearby cavern—warmed by a
mysterious, caged fire elemental—as a sanctuary from the tomb’s
oppressive chill and the biting Eiselcross weather.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Animated Armors</strong>: Tall, hollow guardians of
Salsvault’s foyer, clad in verdigris-stained metal. Moving with the
relentless cadence of machines, these magical constructs proved immune
to enchantments that sway the minds of living beings. They were
destroyed by the party upon entry.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Animated Cutlery</strong>: A silent, murderous swarm of
kitchen implements—cleavers, knives, and other utensils—that flew from
their racks in the Salsvault kitchen to attack the party. Their small
size and vicious speed made for a chaotic and bloody encounter that left
Whisper unconscious before they were all destroyed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Arl Bortock</strong>: A jovial dwarf who tends bar at the
<em>Jolly Dwarf</em> in Palebank Village. He provides the adventurers
with lodging, refreshments, local insights, and identifies the
Liel-Tethwick family. He later promises a thorough cleaning of his inn
upon learning of potential contamination.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Bandits (Croaker Cave)</strong>: Followers of Hulil
Lutan, tasked with defending her operations within Croaker Cave. They
battled the adventurers, resulting in casualties and one captured dwarf
(associated with the Uttolot family) who provided intelligence before
being knocked out.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Bandits (Pelc’s Curiosities)</strong>: Followers of Hulil
Lutan, encountered ransacking the shop searching for clues to cure
Hulil’s Frigid Woe. They engaged the adventurers in combat but
surrendered after several were defeated, revealing Hulil’s location and
affliction.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Bill</strong>: A Glassblade in Palebank Village,
encountered at the <em>Jolly Dwarf</em>, providing warnings about the
dangers of the Frigid Woe and the port closure.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Bret</strong>: A human wizard and member of the Cerberus
Assembly, rescued by the <em>Remorhaz</em> after the <em>Frostfang</em>,
on which he had purchased passage, was destroyed by a giant squid. He
was traveling as a passenger under Captain Gerhard Eisner and seeks
urgent passage to Icehaven in Eiselcross, carrying vital news about
Aeorian constructs encountered in the wastes. Captain Stonebeard has
denied his request for diversion, directing him to Palebank
Village.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Buyer</strong>: An enigmatic figure residing in a
large, well-maintained yurt in Syrinlya. Elro has instructed the party
to deliver the Frigid Woe cure to this individual for teleportation back
to Palebank Village. Orvo Mustave sold his share of the Salsvault
artifacts to this person. Using a <em>Sending</em> spell, this
individual informed Elara of Tulgi Lutan’s death, adding a grim urgency
to the party’s quest.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Doctor Pepe</strong>: Initially a mysterious rogue
observing the adventurers, he formally joined their quest at Croaker
Cave. He contributes sharp investigative skills, stealth, and crossbow
proficiency. He is proving adept at fishing and cooking. In Salsvault,
his Ring of Comprehension has proven invaluable for deciphering the
archaic Draconic script of the Aeorians. He was nearly drowned by a
giant octopus in a flooded library, an experience that has left him with
a profound and unnatural weariness.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Elara</strong>: An aasimar bard whose musical talents and
spellcasting bolster the party. She excels at negotiation, inspiration,
healing, and illusions, and has bonded with others over the novel
<em>Tusk Love</em>. She is mastering new melodies and enchantments,
enhancing her performance and persuasion, and has taken on a guardian
role, watching over Kragor. In Salsvault, she has used her magic to
illuminate foes, heal grievous wounds, and revive the fallen. After
finding a pristine robe on a long-dead novice, she has adopted the
red-robed look of the vault’s original inhabitants. She was the
recipient of a magical message from The Buyer, learning of Tulgi Lutan’s
passing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Elf Acolyte (Croaker Cave)</strong>: A male elf and
devout follower of Hulil Lutan, discovered kneeling beside her before a
tapestry of Tiamat. He engaged the party in combat in defense of his
priestess but was swiftly killed by a crossbow bolt to the neck from
Doctor Pepe.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Elro Aldataur</strong>: A Glassblade leader in Palebank
Village. He introduces the adventurers to the Frigid Woe mystery,
confirms the disease’s name and Aeorian origins, explains the cure
(milky liquid in golden vials), hires the party to retrieve the cure
from Eiselcross, provides payment and bounty for Hulil’s gang, arranges
passage on the <em>Remorhaz</em>, and identifies Orvo Mustave and “The
Buyer” as contacts in Syrinlya. He has also promised to ensure Irven
Liel’s family is cared for.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Fenton Tethwick</strong>: Irven Liel’s husband, traveling
with Irven and their twin tiefling daughters (Honor &amp; Magic). He
helps care for the children while Irven discusses sensitive matters with
the adventurers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ferol Sal</strong>: The undead lord of Salsvault. A
letter found in his immaculate bedchamber reveals his identity and
chilling purpose: having survived Aeor’s fall, he has continued his work
in undeath, seeking to engineer a plague capable of infecting and
destroying the very gods he blames for his city’s destruction.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Fire Elemental (Caged)</strong>: A colossal figure of
silent, eternal flame, suspended within a shimmering electrum
dodecahedron cage, which is itself contained within a massive,
misty-blue sphere. Discovered by Halite and Whisper in a nearby mountain
cavern, this powerful being’s prison appears to be leaking, its immense
heat creating a hot spring in the frozen landscape.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Gerhard Eisner</strong>: The former captain of the
<em>Frostfang</em>, rescued alongside his crewman Rorik and passenger
Bret. Deeply affected by the loss of his ship, he has joined the
adventurers’ quest, contributing his wilderness experience, map-reading
skills, and combat support. His magical ring allowing him to walk on
water proved decisive during the battle with the giant octopus. He has
also taken to wearing one of the strange, un-rotted red robes found in
Salsvault.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Giant Ice Frogs (Croaker Cave)</strong>: Two aggressive,
mastiff-sized, blue-skinned frogs that served as guards in the first
chamber of Croaker Cave. They ambushed Doctor Pepe and Whisper upon
their entry, wounding Whisper before the rest of the party arrived. One
was killed by Elara’s magic, and the other retreated after being wounded
by Doctor Pepe. They are distinct from the much larger,
semi-domesticated Old Croaker.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Giant Octopus</strong>: A slick, purpled monstrosity with
malevolent intelligence, found lurking in the flooded library of
Salsvault. It dragged Doctor Pepe into the depths and ensnared Scarlet
before Halite’s furious trident assault ended its life. Its corpse
exudes a foul, sulfurous odor.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Giant Squid</strong>: A colossal cephalopod encountered
in the fog-laden Frigid Depths. It destroyed the <em>Frostfang</em> and
attacked the <em>Remorhaz</em> before being slain by the combined
efforts of the adventurers and crew. Sparky reported its remains smelled
like farts.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Gramini</strong>: An elderly elf potion vendor at the
Palebank Village docks. She sells the party healing potions, trades for
a Scanlan Shorthalt shirt (which she frames and prices highly), and
offers initial advice about Westeroff.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Griffin</strong>: A magnificent but unnamed griffin
encountered with an arrow lodged in its wing. After Scarlet communicated
with, treated, and healed the beast, it showed its gratitude by allowing
her to ride it for several days. It served as an aerial scout for the
party during their trek across Foren and warned them of giants to the
north before departing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Haldor</strong>: A deck hand on the <em>Remorhaz</em>,
born and raised in snowy lands but with a love for fishing. He confronts
the winter wolf in the kitchen with Ironfist and later bonds with
Whisper while working the rigging, sharing stories of their respective
homes and showing her techniques for tackling ice frozen into
ropes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Halite</strong>: A goliath fighter known for his
strength, tactical mind, and mastery of the trident and javelin. He has
discovered a surprising aptitude for cooking. He delivered the killing
blows to the party’s most fearsome foes, the Giant Squid, the Young
Remorhaz, and the Giant Octopus. After splitting from the party with
Whisper to investigate a steam plume, he co-discovered the cavern of the
caged fire elemental and found a mysterious bottle beneath a console. In
Salsvault’s flooded library, his focused rage and mighty arm brought
down the giant octopus that had seized two of his companions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hulil Lutan</strong>: A dwarf priestess of Tiamat and
sister of Tulgi. Afflicted with Frigid Woe, she led criminal operations
from Croaker Cave, seeking Aeorian artifacts and a cure. Defeated by the
party, her journal revealed the sale of a blue vial to Irven
Liel.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ice Mephits</strong>: Three small, malevolent elemental
creatures of ice, described as “flickering motes of azure” and “shards
of living ice.” They are drawn to the magic sustaining the Salsvault
ruins. Agile fliers, they attack with blasts of frigid air and can
exhale shrouds of dense, swirling fog. They are fragile, exploding into
ice shards when defeated by the party.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ingrid</strong>: The skilled, if gruff, dwarven chef
aboard the <em>Remorhaz</em>. She is revealed to be a lycanthrope
(winter wolf), her transformation tied to a moon-and-rune amulet. She
mentors several party members in cooking, gifting utensils to Kragor,
Halite, and Doctor Pepe in recognition of their talent. She apologized
to Whisper for biting her while transformed, and incongruously offered
sandwiches during the height of the giant squid battle.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ironfist</strong>: The First Mate of the
<em>Remorhaz</em>. He confronts the winter wolf in the kitchen with
Haldor and participates actively in the battle against the giant squid,
manning a ballista and attempting to throw a rescue rope to the
water-walking survivor.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Irven Liel</strong>: A traveling bookseller (specializing
in wholesale) heading to Uthodurn with his husband Fenton and their twin
tiefling daughters. He purchased a cracked blue vial containing Frigid
Woe contagion from Hulil Lutan as an investment. He cooperates with the
party, allowing Scarlet to confirm the danger, and now relies on them
finding the cure for him and his entire family. He is a proponent of
“Feather Leather” as a best-selling book.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Javel</strong>: An ancient, coughing dwarf trader
operating out of a yurt in Syrinlya. He sells the party snowshoes
(including blood-stained ones from a halfling eaten by a yeti) and ice
hammers, bonding with Elara over a shared appreciation for the novel
<em>Tusk Love</em> and gifting her a bottle of Sandkeg’s High whiskey.
He warns them about yetis.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Kragor</strong>: An orc warlock wielding eldritch power
and a conjured war hammer. He has discovered a talent for cooking. He
revealed he gained his power from an otherworldly patron after
experiencing strange dreams and near-death. These have since evolved
into recurring, vivid nightmares, the latest being a vision of being a
human in a tribe, fleeing through a blizzard at a god’s command before
being crushed by ice. Within Salsvault, his use of a ritual to see magic
has allowed him to identify both known and alien schools of power. Like
several others, he has taken to wearing the red robes of the vault’s
former denizens, and continues his paternal watch over the white dragon
egg.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Liel-Tethwicks</strong>: The traveling family
consisting of Irven Liel, his husband Fenton Tethwick, and their twin
tiefling daughters, Honor and Magic. They become entangled in the Frigid
Woe mystery due to Irven’s purchase of a contaminated vial.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mathias</strong>: The harried elf proprietor of
“Mathias’s Stuffs” in Palebank Village, where the party buys supplies
and sells bandit gear. He provides a warning about violent “wild folk”
with black streaks on their faces in Eiselcross.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mera</strong>: The skilled navigator of the
<em>Remorhaz</em>. She participates in the card game, expertly pilots
the ship through fog and during the squid attack, and calculates their
position and arrival time in Syrinlya. She expressed delight at Elara’s
musical performance and the liveliness of the group.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Morgo Delwur</strong>: A stout, weathered dwarf woman
acting as an informal guide or contact in Syrinlya. She directs the
party to Orvo and The Buyer, offers them the yurt of a deceased elf
lordling (eaten by a saber-toothed tiger), and mentions local dangers
before heading off on her own expedition.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Old Croaker</strong>: A giant ice frog of unusual size
dwelling in Croaker Cave. Used by Hulil’s bandits (and later the party)
for transport across an underground pool, motivated by treats (bats, elf
hands). It attacked Whisper when startled. Scarlet confirmed it is
venomous.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Orvo Mustave</strong>: A dwarf adventurer in Syrinlya and
friend of the deceased Urgon, identified by a distinctive three-line
scar on his cheek. He accompanied Urgon on the expedition where the blue
vials were found in the Salsvault ruins (located in the Thin Sheets
region). He provides the party with directions, details about the ruins’
dangers (Ice Mephits, animated armor), confirms he sold his share of
artifacts to The Buyer, and directs them to Javel for snowshoes. He is
saddened and angered by Urgon’s death.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rorik</strong>: A young human crewman from the
<em>Frostfang</em>, rescued alongside Captain Gerhard Eisner and Bret.
He seems loyal to Gerhard.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rug of Smothering</strong>: An animate carpet found in a
ruined Salsvault storeroom. It attempted to suffocate Halite and then
Scarlet before the druid’s transformation into a draft horse tore it
from its grapple, after which it was quickly destroyed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scanlan Shorthalt</strong>: A legendary and widely
popular bard, known through his merchandise and literary works rather
than a personal appearance. His name appears on a rare shirt the party
barters to Gramini for a discount, and his book, <em>Adventure Sexy:
Impress Potential Lovers with Great Deeds</em>, is found in an abandoned
yurt in Syrinlya.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scarlet</strong>: A halfling druid deeply connected to
nature. She has an owl companion (“Sparky”) used for scouting. She
communicated with and healed a griffin, riding it to scout ahead. Inside
the sterile walls of Salsvault, she has adapted her powers, using fire
to melt ice and taking the form of a wild boar to fight constructs and a
massive draft horse to escape a rug of smothering. To save a drowning
Doctor Pepe, she dove into the icy waters of a flooded library, her
healing magic a desperate spark in the gloom.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sparky</strong>: Scarlet’s owl familiar. A loyal and
effective scout, Sparky provides aerial reconnaissance for the party. He
scouted the fog-laden sea for land, reporting back to Scarlet that the
remains of the giant squid “smelled bad… like farts.” He also proves
helpful with navigating the featureless terrain of Foren.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Stonebeard</strong>: The seasoned captain of the
<em>Remorhaz</em>. Initially deferential to Elro, he reveals a
pragmatic, no-nonsense command style once at sea. He oversees ship
operations, directs the crew during crises (the lycanthropy incident and
the squid attack), interacts with the rescued survivors, and safely
navigates to Syrinlya. His ship requires weeks of repair before another
crossing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Swarm of Undead Snakes</strong>: A roiling ball of tiny,
desiccated, and venomous undead serpents that erupted from a chest in
Ferol Sal’s private quarters. The swarm was obliterated by a radiant
blow from Kragor’s war hammer.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tulgi Lutan</strong>: A solitary trapper in Palebank
Village and sister of Hulil. Afflicted with Frigid Woe, she confessed
her and Hulil’s criminal activities and theft from Urgon, revealing
Hulil’s location in Croaker Cave. As confirmed by a message from The
Buyer, she has since succumbed to the disease.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Undead Figure</strong>: A solitary, decaying humanoid
figure encountered walking with unnerving precision across the frozen
landscape of Foren. The sound of its voice is like “grinding stone,” and
it appears to be sightless. It is driven by a singular, obsessive
purpose, asking, “Where is Lucien?” The party redirected it towards the
River Inferno, hoping it would incinerate itself. Scarlet identified it
as undead.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Urgon Wenth</strong>: A dwarven adventurer whose return
from Eiselcross afflicted with Frigid Woe and subsequent death sparked
the story’s central mystery. He recovered Aeorian artifacts, including
the blue vials containing the contagion, from the Salsvault ruins
alongside Orvo Mustave.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Verla Pelc</strong>: The owner of Pelc’s Curiosities in
Palebank Village. Found frozen dead in her shop by the adventurers, a
victim of the Frigid Woe after purchasing the blue vials from Urgon and
handling them.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Westeroff</strong>: A retired wizard in Palebank Village.
He provides limited magical identification services, confirms Urgon’s
dagger is magical, sells Halite a crystal focus, and identifies a garnet
for Doctor Pepe. He is notably not a fan of music.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Whisper</strong>: A tabaxi monk known for exceptional
agility, stealth, and scouting. She survived being partially swallowed
by an ice frog and bitten by Ingrid in wolf form. With Halite, she
discovered the cavern of the caged elemental, where her curiosity led
her to tamper with a strange lever. She has been battered and stabbed by
flying cutlery in Salsvault, but her resilience sees her ever ready for
the next fight. She has taken to wearing the strange, well-preserved red
robes of the vault’s dead.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>White Dragon Egg</strong>: A massive, three-foot-tall,
alabaster-white egg discovered by Halite on the Foren plains. Radiating
an intense cold, it was identified by Scarlet as a white dragon egg that
is perilously close to hatching. Kragor, having declared it an “orphan”
like himself, has adopted it as his own, carefully protecting it from
extreme temperatures, such as the heat of the elemental cavern.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Young Remorhaz</strong>: A monstrous, heat-radiating,
segmented worm native to Eiselcross, capable of burrowing through snow
and ice. The party encountered and defeated a juvenile remorhaz,
confirming its aggressive, predatory nature and its unique internal
furnace that consumes objects on contact. Its iridescent scales (thrym)
offer fire resistance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Zombies (Salsvault)</strong>: The reanimated novices and
workers of Ferol Sal, found throughout the ruin. Clad in unnaturally
well-preserved red robes of a strange plant-like fiber, these desiccated
corpses are slow but relentless. They possess the ability to rise again
after being struck down, unless destroyed utterly by radiant energy or
overwhelming force.</p></li>
