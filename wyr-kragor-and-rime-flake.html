<h1>Kragor and Rime-flake</h1>
<p>The wind howling down from the jagged teeth of Foren’s frozen peaks
did not merely bite; it chewed. It was a gnawing, insistent beast that
sought to strip the warmth from bone and marrow, a fitting companion for
the pair huddled in the lee of a wind-scoured rock formation, a few
miles shy of the shivering outpost of Syrinlya.</p>
<p>Kragor sat cross-legged on a patch of permafrost he had diligently
cleared of snow. He was a long, ropey figure of an orc, possessing
little of the chaotic bulk common to his kin. His frame was all wire and
leverage, draped in furs that smelled of ozone and old smoke. His face,
lean and sharp-tusked, held the weary patience of a man who had spent
his youth dodging the heavy boots of city guards in back alleys far
warmer than this frozen hell.</p>
<p>Before him, curled like a glistening, thorny shrimp, lay Rime-flake.
The white dragon wyrmling was five feet of absolute, crystalline malice,
currently dormant. Their scales were the color of a clouded mirror, and
their breath puffed out in little rhythmic clouds that turned instantly
to ice crystals on the air.</p>
<p>“Wake up, you frost-bitten lizard,” Kragor murmured, though the tone
was affectionate. “School is in session.”</p>
<p>The orc reached into a pouch at his belt, withdrawing a pinch of soot
and a grain of rock salt. He began the ritual, a slow, ten-minute
rhythmic chanting that felt less like casting a spell and more like
greasing a lock. The starry, incomprehensible void that whispered in his
ear enjoyed the breaking of barriers. <em>Comprehend Languages.</em> The
magic settled over Kragor’s mind like a wet, heavy blanket, filtering
the world’s noise into discernible meaning.</p>
<p>Flake’s eye, a pool of pale, milky blue, snapped open. A low rumble
started in his chest. <em>«Hunger. Meat. Warmth. Where?»</em></p>
<p>The ritual caught the Draconic growls and translated them into
concepts Kragor’s street-smart brain could parse.</p>
<p>“Meat later. Words first,” Kragor said. He stood, his movements
fluid, lacking the lumbering gait of a warrior. He had the grace of a
pickpocket. “Pay attention, Flake.”</p>
<p>Kragor stood with arms crossed. For this he needed no book, no magic
words, no mystical gestures. His magic was the magic of the lie, the
cheat, the beautiful fabrication. He tapped into the <em>Misty
Visions</em> eldritch invocation, that endless well of deception his
patron granted him.</p>
<p>The air between them shimmered, and then the mist coalesced into an
image. It was crude at first, then sharpened into the form of an orc, a
specimen typical of the species. The illusionary orc stood tall, leaning
on a greataxe, looking imperious.</p>
<p>Kragor pointed a long, grey finger at his own chest, then at the
illusion.</p>
<p>“<em>Nothok</em>,” Kragor enunciated, the Orcish word heavy and
guttural.</p>
<p>The wyrmling uncoiled, neck snapping forward with the speed of a
striking cobra. He sniffed the illusion. It smelled of nothing.
Disappointed, Flake looked at the much more corporal Kragor.</p>
<p><em>«Soft-skin. Meat-giver.»</em></p>
<p>“No,” Kragor corrected, shaking his head. He tapped his chest again,
harder. “<em>Nothok</em>.”</p>
<p>Flake tilted his head, the icy frills rattling. He let out a chuffing
sound, a sharp bark of noise. “<em>Ghik</em>.”</p>
<p><em>«Orc.»</em></p>
<p>Kragor smiled, a flash of tusks. “Good. <em>Ghik</em>. I am the
<em>ghik</em>. I am the <em>nothok</em>.”</p>
<p>Kragor waved his hand, and the illusion dissolved into swirling
vapor. In its place, he willed a new vision. This one was grander. He
sculpted the mist into a dragon—not a wyrmling, but a majestic, adult
white dragon, wings spread wide, jaws open in a silent roar. It was pure
theater, a grander evolution of the crude distractions and
sleight-of-hand Kragor had used to baffle marks in the bazaars, long
before the stars whispered their secrets to him.</p>
<p>He pointed to the magnificent beast, then pointed to the small,
frosty pug on the ground.</p>
<p>“<em>Kulkodar</em>,” Kragor said, infusing the word with
reverence.</p>
<p>Flake puffed up his chest. He extended his own wings, mimicking the
illusion. The vanity of the species was present even in the egg; the
wyrmling looked at the image and saw no difference between its grandeur
and his own small, deadly form.</p>
<p>“<em>Darastrix</em>,” Flake hissed, the sibilance carrying the pride
of emperors.</p>
<p><em>«Dragon.»</em></p>
<p>“Aye, you vain little monster,” Kragor chuckled. “<em>Kulkodar</em>.
<em>Darastrix</em>.”</p>
<p>Now for the hook. Kragor knew that to control a bully, one must
control the desire. He dissolved the dragon and conjured yet another
image: a heavy, iron-bound chest. The lid was thrown back, revealing a
heap of gold coins and glittering gems.</p>
<p>To sell the con, Kragor leveraged the cantrip <em>Minor
Illusion</em>. From the silent image came the distinct, heavy
clink-clatter of gold coins spilling over one another.</p>
<p>Flake’s pupil dilated until his eye was entirely black. The instinct
was ancient, coded into his being before he had even cracked his shell.
He lunged, jaws snapping shut on the air.</p>
<p>His teeth passed through the mist. The clink continued, mocking
him.</p>
<p>Flake let out a screech of frustration, swiping a claw at the empty
air. <em>«Mine! Sparkles! Where?»</em></p>
<p>Kragor stepped in, holding up a finger. “Not real, Flake. Magic.
Look.” He pointed at the illusion. “<em>Grumbull</em>.”</p>
<p>The dragon snarled, agitated. He wanted the hoard. He wanted to sleep
on it.</p>
<p>“Say it, and you get a snack,” Kragor bargained, producing a strip of
dried jerky from his pocket.</p>
<p>Flake eyed the meat, then the fake chest. The calculus of survival
outweighed the greed for a moment.</p>
<p>“<em>Rasvim</em>,” the wyrmling grumbled, the word dripping with
acquisitive lust.</p>
<p><em>«Treasure.»</em></p>
<p>Kragor tossed the jerky. Flake snatched it out of the air with a snap
that could have severed a hand.</p>
<p>“Last one,” Kragor said, wiping meat dust on his trousers. “Then we
hunt.”</p>
<p>He altered the illusion of the chest, reshaping it back into the
dragon. But this time, he animated it. The dragon beat its wings,
lifting off the ground, circling higher and higher into the grey sky
above the camp.</p>
<p>Kragor pointed at the soaring phantom, then looked at Flake. He made
a sweeping gesture upward with his arms.</p>
<p>“<em>Zes</em>,” Kragor commanded.</p>
<p>Flake chewed the jerky contentedly, refusing to move. The ground was
stable. The sky was work.</p>
<p>Kragor sighed. He concentrated, moving the illusionary dragon so it
swooped down, acting as if it were about to steal the remaining jerky
from Kragor’s pouch.</p>
<p>“It’s going to take the rest,” Kragor lied effortlessly, his skills
of deception selling the casual warning.</p>
<p>Flake’s head snapped up. Rivalry. He wouldn’t let a cloud-ghost take
his due! The wyrmling launched himself upward, claws scrambling on the
ice for traction, wings beating frantically until he caught the updraft.
He rose, five feet, ten feet, intercepting the illusion.</p>
<p>“<em>Zes</em>!” Kragor shouted up at him.</p>
<p>Flake batted through the smoke, realized he had been duped again, but
held the hover, looking down at the orc with imperious disdain.</p>
<p>“<em>Austrat</em>!” he shrieked down, the wind of his wings kicking
up snow around the warlock.</p>
<p><em>«Fly!»</em></p>
<p>Kragor grinned, pulling his collar up against the wash of displaced
air. The wyrmling drifted back down, landing with a heavy thump that
cracked the ice. The lesson was over. The trust was tenuous, bought with
lies and jerky, but it was there.</p>
<p>“Good one, Flake,” Kragor whispered, canceling the spell. The mist
vanished, leaving only the biting wind. He watched the wyrmling settle
back onto the ice, a small, perfect engine of destruction already
preening with an emperor’s pride. Kragor saw the future coiled within
that frosty form—the power to shatter armies, to become a god of ice and
fear, another tyrant ruling from a throne of frozen bones. He’d seen
that same arrogance in the eyes of petty street lords, and he felt a
cold knot of resolve in his gut. This one would be different. This one
would learn that true strength wasn’t the power to command, but the will
to be commanded by none. “Be your own master,” Kragor murmured, the
words almost lost in the gale. “Not someone else’s.”</p>
