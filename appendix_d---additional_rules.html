show the layout of a dungeon level.</p>
<p><strong>Ability:</strong> Wisdom.</p>
<p><strong>Crafting:</strong> Map.</p>
<p><strong>Components.</strong> Cartographer’s tools consist of a quill,
ink, parchment, a pair of compasses, calipers, and a ruler.</p>
<p><strong>Arcana, History, Religion.</strong> You can use your
knowledge of maps and locations to unearth more detailed information
when you use these skills. For instance, you might spot hidden messages
in a map, identify when the map was made to determine if geographical
features have changed since then, and so forth.</p>
<p><strong>Nature.</strong> Your familiarity with physical geography
makes it easier for you to answer questions or solve issues relating to
the terrain around you.</p>
<p><strong>Survival.</strong> Your understanding of geography makes it
easier to find paths to civilization, to predict areas where villages or
towns might be found, and to avoid becoming lost. You have studied so
many maps that common patterns, such as how trade routes evolve and
where settlements arise in relation to geographic locations, are
familiar to you.</p>
<p><strong>Craft a Map.</strong> While traveling, you can draw a map as
you go in addition to engaging in other activity.</p>
