<h1>Can a hatchling speak?</h1>
<p>When a dragon hatches, can it understand Draconic? Or does it need to
be taught?</p>
<p>Original edition D&amp;D sources do not address this question,
treating dragons primarily as distinct sets of combat statistics.
Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons 1st Edition simply gave each type of
dragon a percentage “chance to speak” without regard to age.</p>
<p>In Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2nd Edition, it is implied that
all dragons “speak their own tongue”, and even hatchlings may have the
ability to communicate:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>White dragons speak their own tongue, a tongue common to all evil
dragons, and 7% of hatchling white dragons have an ability to
communicate with any intelligent creature. The chance to possess this
ability increases 5% per age category of the dragon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the 1990 <em>Draconomicon</em> for Advanced Dungeons &amp;
Dragons 2nd Edition introduced biology and ecology for dragons. There it
is explicitly stated that a dragon must learn Draconic:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Language is also an acquired attribute. Like any other intelligent
creature, dragons can acquire a language only from another creature who
speaks that language. Thus it is quite possible for a copper dragon
never to learn the copper tongue. Dragons raised by humans generally
learn only the common tongue, unless their parent is proficient in other
languages (and wishes to teach them).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, there was a transition in later editions. This began with a
partial shift in 1994’s <em>Council of Wyrms</em> adventure module. That
module introduced “prenatal learning”: a dragon would learn language
during the long incubation period.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dragons instinctively know a select number of combat and noncombat
proficiencies upon hatching, as per the rules in Book One. Dragons learn
some of these proficiencies subliminally as they grow within their eggs.
They learn the modern-languages proficiency, for example, by listening
to the sounds of dragon speech that filter in through their shells.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then with 3rd Edition’s 2003 <em>Draconomicon: The Book of
Dragons</em>, the concept of “inherited knowledge” was introduced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A wyrmling emerges from its egg fully formed and ready to face life.
From the tip of its nose to the end of its tail, it is about twice as
long as the egg that held it.</p>
<p>A newly hatched dragon emerges from its egg cramped and sodden. After
about an hour, it is ready to fly, fight, and reason. It inherits a
considerable body of practical knowledge from its parents, though such
inherent knowledge often lies buried in the wyrmling’s memory, unnoticed
and unused until it is needed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>4th Edition’s 2008 <em>Draconomicon: Chromatic Dragons</em>
doubles-down on this concept and ties it to limited inherited
memory:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A newly hatched dragon has a full array of abilities. Although
inferior to those of a young dragon, these abilities are sufficient for
the wyrmling to take care of itself, at least against relatively weak
threats and predators. Although an emerging wyrmling is sodden and
somewhat awkward, it can run within hours of hatching and can fly within
a day or two. A wyrmling’s senses are fully acute, and—due to the
interweaving of a dragon’s centers of memory and instinct—it is born
with a substantial amount of its parents’ knowledge imprinted in its
mind.</p>
<p>Even so, a dragon is not born with the full memories of prior
generations. Rather, a wyrmling has a grasp of the generalities of the
world and of its own identity. It knows how to move, how to use its
innate abilities, who and what its parents are, and—perhaps most
important—how to view the world around it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, 3rd Edition’s <em>Monster Manual</em> simply says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All dragons speak Draconic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And further editions always include the ability to speak Draconic in
stat blocks, including those for wyrmlings.</p>
<p>It seems not uncommon for eggs to hatch after abandonment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>White dragon eggs had to be buried in snow or encased in ice while
incubating. The parents did not bother to tend or protect the eggs in
any way, although they would usually lay them near their lairs.</p>
<p>— <a
href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/White_dragon"><em>Forgotten
Realms Wiki</em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Young adults, particularly evil or less intelligent ones, tend to lay
annual clutches of eggs all around the countryside, leaving their
offspring to fend for themselves.</p>
<p>… [Y]ounger dragons most often part after mating and leave their eggs
untended.</p>
<p>— <em>Draconomicon: The Book of Dragons (2003)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given that, along with in-game rules stating that wyrmlings speak
Draconic, we can infer that wyrmlings must gain language understanding
without instruction.</p>
<p>Finally, the 5th edition sourcebook <em>Fizban’s Treasury of
Dragons</em> goes further and introduces the concept of the “First
World”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The elegy suggests that before the myriad worlds of the Material
Plane came into being, before Oerth and Toril and Eberron and Krynn
existed, the primordial dragons—Bahamut and Tiamat—worked together to
create the Material Plane in the form of a single First World. All the
worlds that now constitute the plane are, in the words of the poem,
“seedling realities” formed when the First World was sundered in some
unexplained catastrophe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And furthermore that all dragons are mystically linked to other
incarnations:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dragons’ unique connection to the magic of the Material Plane and the
history of the First World gives them a mysterious link to other dragons
across the myriad worlds of the Material Plane. … Occasionally, dragons
develop a sense known as dragonsight—an awareness of multiple
incarnations of themselves across different worlds of the Material
Plane.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This provides yet another possibility for Draconic language
acquisition: it is magically innate to dragons.</p>
<p>In conclusion, a recently hatched wyrmling ought to understand and
speak Draconic due to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prenatal learning</strong>: Months of hearing Draconic while
in the shell.</li>
<li><strong>Genetic memory</strong>: Inherited knowledge from the dragon
parents.</li>
<li><strong>Innate magic</strong>: Connection to the First World and
echoes across worlds.</li>
</ul>
