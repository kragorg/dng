<h1 id="welcome-to-palebank-village">Welcome to Palebank Village</h1>
<p><span class="dropcap">In the frosty expanse of the</span> colder
reaches of Wildemount, in the Greying Wildlands south of the Islands of
Eiselcross, lies the haphazard cluster known as Palebank Village. It is
a place more cobbled together than planned, with just over a hundred
cabins and shacks pressed against the northern cliffs that rise a mere
fifteen feet against the lapping rhythms of the icy harbor waves. The
docks, busy with the absence of departing ships, whisper tales of
neglect and wariness.</p>
<p>On this frigid day, the village is subdued, gathered in mournful
procession for the unfortunate Urgon, a dwarven adventurer whose final
journey is to the graveyard west of the harbor. There, encased in a
casket more suitable for a relic than a beloved friend, he lies
suspended in a state of frozen eternity. Villagers whisper tales of his
return from a year-long venture into Eiselcross, burdened with treasures
and a chilling affliction. Despite countless efforts, Urgon was never
able to find warmth. Eventually, blue streaks marred his pallor, snaking
through his veins, until his entire being succumbed to the grip of
frost.</p>
<p>The adventurers follow the procession, taking note of the landscape
dotted with quaint inns and supply shops. Amongst the mourners stands a
weathered elf adorned with the insignia of a “Glassblade.” Introducing
himself as Elro, he shares that the usual voyages to Aeor have ceased, a
silent testament to the mystery shrouding Urgon’s demise. Elro seeks
their help in unveiling the source of this insidious curse, admitting
that Urgon’s home remains unexplored.</p>
<p>Word reaches the adventurers quickly that another villager named
Tulgi shows similar symptoms— her fate seemingly entwined with Urgon’s.
Fortuitously, their cabins stand in proximity.</p>
<h2 id="beer-with-the-locals">Beer with the Locals</h2>
<p>In the heart of the village, a jovial dwarf Arl Bortock tends bar at
the local tavern. Elara, ever inquisitive, engages Arl in conversation
about Urgon’s recent exploits. A night’s rest is negotiated— two rooms
for eight silver pieces— before the adventurers are served beer by the
bucket and a meal of squid rolls.</p>
<p>Bill, a stalwart Glassblade at one of the tavern tables, emphasizes
that due to the danger of the curse, all boats are being warned off from
Palebank’s docks. Meanwhile, the adventurers learn Tulgi is a solitary
trapper, her life a mystery to most.</p>
<h2 id="the-cabins-of-urgon-and-tulgi">The Cabins of Urgon and
Tulgi</h2>
<p>With this knowledge, they venture to Urgon’s cabin where another
Glassblade vigilantly stands post. Halite leads them inside, where chaos
has left its mark. The mounted head of a snowy beast with gray horns
seems to oversee the search. Books are strewn about, gear tossed aside
as if someone has desperately sought something. Scarlet’s keen eyes
catch sight of a grappling hook, swiftly claiming it. Meanwhile, with a
sharp mind for details, Halite discovers a receipt within a book. Dated
two months prior, it records the sale of Aeorian items at the local
Pelc’s Curiosities for a handsome sum of one thousand gold pieces. Among
the items: a dagger, a scroll case, a jade statue, a quiver of arrows, a
jasper-set silver ring, and two blue glass vials.</p>
<p>Their eyes trace tracks leading to Tulgi Lutan’s snow-burdened cabin.
The warmth of a fierce fire belies the untouched exterior and shuttered
windows. Scarlet’s knock brings a curt response, followed by Elara’s
soft words which coax the door open. Tulgi’s face, marked by the same
blue streaks that have doomed Urgon, is a testament to her shared
affliction. She admits her illness, confessing that she and her sister
Hulil, newcomers from Shadycreek Run, are in league with a crime
syndicate. They have been sent to pilfer Aeorian treasures. It is they
who have ransacked Urgon’s home, and Tulgi now surrenders a finely
wrought dagger into Kragor’s keeping.</p>
<p>She says that her sister Hulil holds the remainder of the treasures
in Croaker Cave, though Tulgi has not seen her in weeks.</p>
<h2 id="onward">Onward</h2>
<p>With their next destination clear, the adventurers hike to Pelc’s
Curiosities. They find the shop marked by a dragon-gilded “P,” where the
front door sags invitingly open, beckoning them into the next chapter of
this unfolding tale.</p>
