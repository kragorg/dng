### Adventure Sexy {#adventure-sexy .item}
<span class="item-type">_Book, uncommon_</span>

Penned by the illustrious, if not always entirely humble, bard Scanlan Shorthalt, this exquisite leather-bound tome with its full title “Adventure Sexy: Impress Potential Lovers with Great Deeds” emblazoned in glittering gold leaf is less a guide to genuine heroism and more a compendium of dramatically (and often exaggerated) retold exploits, carefully curated for maximum romantic appeal.

While it contains questionable advice on actual adventuring, “Adventure Sexy” is filled with Scanlan’s unique brand of bravado, wit, and selective memory, offering numerous examples of how to creatively (and sometimes stretching the truth) present one’s deeds to potential romantic interests. It’s more a testament to Scanlan’s ego and showmanship than a source of arcane power.

### Aeorian Dagger, +1 {#dagger .item}
<span class="item-type">_Weapon, uncommon_</span>

A finely wrought dagger previously sold to Pelc’s Curiosities, pilfered by Tulgi Lutan, and surrendered by same to Kragor Grimstride. With the rest of the party’s blessing, Kragor ultimately gifted the dagger to Doctor Pepe.

You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

This weapon has the following mastery property. To use this property, you must have a feature that lets you use it.

**Nick.** When you make the extra attack of the **Light** property, you can make it as part of the Attack action instead of as a Bonus Action. You can make this extra attack only once per turn.

### Arrows, +1 {#arrows .item}
<span class="item-type">_Weapon, uncommon_</span>

You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this piece of magic ammunition. Once it hits a target, the ammunition is no longer magical.

### Bald Dwarf Whisky {#whisky .item}
<span class="item-type">_Consumable, uncommon_</span>

An Uthodurnian specialty spirit, with an estimated value of 25 gp.

### Gilded Scroll Case {#scroll-case .item}
<span class="item-type">_Gear_</span>

A finely crafted mahogany container adorned with gold filigree and inlaid gemstones, providing both beauty and protection for the scrolls inside. It features runes that offer magical safeguarding against damage, making it ideal for keeping valuable parchments secure.

### Ice Hammer {#ice-hammer .item}
<span class="item-type">_Gear_</span>

A specialized tool for navigating treacherous icy and snowy environments, an ice hammer features a sharp pick on one side of its head and a hammer on the other, mounted on a sturdy haft, with a looped cord for securing to the wrist. It is primarily used for cutting into ice to create handholds or anchor points, and for balance.

**Climbing.** When you are climbing on ice or snow and are using an ice hammer in one or both hands, you can use your reaction when you would fall to attempt a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check to stop your fall. On a success, your fall is arrested, and you remain clinging to the surface.

An ice hammer provides advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks made to climb surfaces of ice or packed snow that offer suitable purchase for the pick.

**Ice breaking.** An ice hammer can also be used to break through thin ice. You can use an action to strike a surface of ice. For every inch of ice thickness, this requires a successful DC 10 Strength check. On a success, you break through up to 1 inch of ice.


### Jade Statuette of a Storm Giant {#statuette .item}
<span class="item-type">_Miscellaneous_</span>

A meticulously carved figurine, standing approximately eight inches tall, depicting a storm giant in mid-roar, with intricate details capturing the raw power and majesty of its kind. The deep green jade shimmers with veins of gold, suggesting latent magical energies, and when held during a lightning storm, the statuette seems to vibrate softly, as if resonating with the storm’s fury. Ancient runes inscribed at the base suggest it could be used in rituals to commune with primal forces of nature, potentially granting temporary insight or power related to storms.

### Silver Ring {#ring .item}
<span class="item-type">_Jewelry_</span>

A silver ring with an inset jasper stone, valued at 50 gold pieces.

### Snowshoes {#snowshoes .item}
<span class="item-type">_Gear_</span>

These sturdy snowshoes are constructed with a wooden frame, strung with durable babiche (rawhide lacing) for the webbing. Animal hide straps and bindings secure them firmly to your boots. The underside features a series of sharp, durable metal spikes and edges (crampons) to bite into icy surfaces. They are designed to withstand the harsh, cold environment and provide reliable, non-magical assistance on the ice and snow. They are specifically adapted for the varied and often treacherous conditions of the Thin Sheets, though they require careful handling.

**Speed.** While wearing these snowshoes, you ignore difficult terrain caused by deep snow and non-slippery ice. Your speed is reduced by 10 feed when not moving on ice or snow.

**Distributed weight.** The snowshoes’ design helps to distribute your weight slightly. When moving across thin ice, you gain a +2 bonus to the DC of any check to see if the ice breaks under you.

### Oil {#oil .item}
<span class="item-type">_Gear_</span>

You can douse a creature, object, or space with Oil or use it as fuel, as detailed below.

*Dousing a Creature or an Object.* When you take the Attack action, you can replace one of your attacks with throwing an Oil flask. Target one creature or object within 20 feet of yourself. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw (DC 8 plus your Dexterity modifier and Proficiency Bonus) or be covered in oil. If the target takes Fire damage before the oil dries (after 1 minute), the target takes an extra 5 Fire damage from burning oil.

*Dousing a Space.* You can take the Utilize action to pour an Oil flask on level ground to cover a 5-foot-square area within 5 feet of yourself. If lit, the oil burns until the end of the turn 2 rounds from when the oil was lit (or 12 seconds) and deals 5 Fire damage to any creature that enters the area or ends its turn there. A creature can take this damage only once per turn.

*Fuel.* Oil serves as fuel for Lamps and Lanterns. Once lit, a flask of Oil burns for 6 hours in a Lamp or Lantern. That duration doesn’t need to be consecutive; you can extinguish the burning Oil (as a Utilize action) and rekindle it again until it has burned for a total of 6 hours.

### Hulil’s Journal {#journal .item}
<span class="item-type">_Book, common_</span>

Hulil Lutan’s journal, mentioning that she sold a vial of blue powder to Irven Liel.
