## Magic Tattoos {#magic-tattoos .item}
<span class="item-type">_Wondrous item (tattoo), rarity varies_</span>

_Source: Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything, Homebrew_

Blending magic and artistry with ink and needles,
magic tattoos imbue their bearers with wondrous abilities.
The creation of a magic tattoo is a rare art,
typically accomplished in one of two ways.

The first method involves binding the magic to the tool itself,
creating a magic needle.
This enchanted item holds the tattoo’s power latent within it,
ready to be transferred.
Anyone can then use this needle
to inscribe the design
and release its magic into a creature’s skin.

The second method requires a direct conduit of power.
A warlock, using a mundane needle and
ink prepared from powdered gems,
can channel their patron’s energy through the tool as they work,
infusing the ink with their pact magic as it is set into the flesh.

Once inscribed on a creature’s body, damage or injury doesn’t
impair the tattoo’s function, even if the tattoo is defaced. When
applying a magic tattoo, a creature can customize the tattoo’s
appearance. A magic tattoo can look like a brand, scarification, a
birthmark, patterns of scales, or any other cosmetic alteration.

### Eldritch Tattoo {#eldritch-tattoo .item}
<span class="item-type">_Wondrous item (tattoo), rarity varies_</span>

_Source: Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything, Homebrew_

Inscribed by a warlock
who channels their patron’s power
through a needle and specially prepared ink,
this tattoo contains a single spell of up to 5th level.
The warlock infuses the ink with otherworldly energy
as they create the design directly on a creature’s skin.
The tattoo’s appearance often reflects
the nature of the patron who empowered it—
fiery lines for a Fiend,
twisting patterns for a Great Old One,
or thorny vines for an Archfey.

Once the tattoo is on a creature’s skin,
the creature can cast its spell,
requiring no material components.
The tattoo glows with an otherworldly light
while the creature casts the spell
and for the spell’s duration.
Once the spell ends,
the tattoo vanishes from the creature’s skin.

The level of the spell in the tattoo determines the spell’s saving
throw DC, attack bonus, spellcasting ability modifier, and the
tattoo’s rarity, as shown in the Eldritch Tattoo table.

Table: Eldritch Tattoo

| Spell Level | Rarity   | Spellcasting Ability Mod. | Save DC | Attack Bonus |
|-------------|----------|---------------------------|---------|--------------|
| Cantrip     | Common   | +3                        | 13      | +5           |
| 1st         | Common   | +3                        | 13      | +5           |
| 2nd         | Uncommon | +3                        | 13      | +5           |
| 3rd         | Uncommon | +4                        | 15      | +7           |
| 4th         | Rare     | +4                        | 15      | +7           |
| 5th         | Rare     | +5                        | 17      | +9           |


The rarer a magic tattoo is, the more space it typically occupies on a
creature’s skin. The Magic Tattoo Coverage table offers guidelines for
how large a given tattoo is.

Table: Magic Tattoo Coverage

| Tattoo Rarity | Area Covered                            |
| -             | -                                       |
| Common        | One hand or foot or a quarter of a limb |
| Uncommon      | Half a limb or the scalp                |
| Rare          | One limb                                |
| Very Rare     | Two limbs or the chest or upper back    |
| Legendary     | Two limbs and the torso                 |


#### Crafting an Eldritch Tattoo

_Source: Player’s Handbook, Dungeon Master’s Guide, Homebrew_

We use the rules for crafting spell scrolls with modifications:

To craft an _Eldritch Tattoo_, you and any assistants must have
proficiency in the _Arcana_ skill. You must be proficient with
_Tattooist’s Tools_ and use them to create the tattoo. Any assistants
must also have proficiency.

A spellcaster can transfer a spell onto a willing creature’s skin and
create an *Eldritch Tattoo*, using the rules below.

**Time and Cost.** Creating a tattoo takes an amount of time and money
based on the level of the spell, as shown in the Eldritch Tattoo
Costs table. For each day of inscription, you must work for 8 hours. If
a tattoo requires multiple days, those days needn’t be consecutive.

**Prerequisites for the Tattooist.** To create a tattoo, you must have
proficiency in the _Arcana_ skill and with _Tattooist’s Tools_ and have
the spell prepared on each day of the inscription. You must also have at
hand any Material components required by the spell; if the spell
consumes its Material components, they are consumed only when you
complete the tattoo. The tattoo’s spell uses your spell save DC and
spell attack bonus.

**Cantrips.** If the tattooed spell is a cantrip, the version on
the tattoo works as if the caster were your level.

Table: Eldritch Tattoo Costs


| Spell Level | Time    | Cost      |
| -           | -       | -         |
| Cantrip     | 1 day   | 15 GP     |
