<h1 id="journey-to-eiselcross">Journey to Eiselcross</h1>
<p><span class="dropcap">Kragor jolts awake. For the</span> moment, he
is entombed in silent, crushing blue ice. His heart beats sluggishly,
almost still. His limbs are heavy, unresponsive, locked in glacial
stasis he cannot break. He senses immense weight, groaning sighs of
unimaginable pressure, almost imperceptible cracking echoing through the
endless blue tomb.</p>
<p>Then, he gasps, back in the Remorhaz’s cabin, the phantom cold
clinging to him. His hands feel… gritty. Confused, his mind thick with
the memory of ice, he raises them into the faint moonlight. Dirt. Dark,
loamy earth is packed beneath his fingernails.</p>
<p>Where did this come from? He swings his legs out of the bunk,
scanning the cramped space. His bunk is as he left it; nothing is
disturbed. Still bewildered, he settles back and begins a slow ritual to
attune himself to the presence of magic, desperate for an explanation.
Extending his arcane senses, he scans the cabin. Enchanted auras bloom
nearby: the dagger Doctor Pepe carries… but also something else he does
not recognize. Further away, Ingrid’s lycanthropy-suppressing amulet. He
checks his bunk, his gear, himself. Nothing. No trace of sorcery
explains the vivid nightmare or the impossible dirt. He stares at his
hands, the earthy grit a stubborn, unsettling riddle.</p>
<p>Dawn breaks on the fourth day of the adventurer’s journey across the
Frigid Depths. A thick fog stretches endlessly before the Remorhaz,
reducing the world to a spectral canvas of grays and whites. Visibility
collapses to a mere fifty feet, transforming the sea into a
claustrophobic realm where sound becomes more reliable than sight.</p>
<p>Chef Ingrid prepares a feast of gratitude. Massive platters of smoked
fish, hearty breads, and steaming porridge cover the galley table, a
culinary apology wrapped in steam and seasoning.</p>
<p>Pulling Whisper aside, Ingrid’s voice is soft, almost apologetic.
“Sorry about the little nip,” she murmurs. “In that form, control is…
challenging. I just like to chase cats.” A plate of poke appears, raw
fish marinated in vibrant seasonings, offered as both peace offering and
cultural delicacy.</p>
<p>Captain Stonebeard’s voice cuts through the morning calm. “We need
all eyes on deck!” The ship’s bell rings, a sonic marker declaring their
position to potential listeners in this spectral seascape. “Passengers,”
he commands, “keep your eyes over the rail. Raise the alarm if you spot
anything that could lead to collision!”</p>
<p>Whisper and Haldor ascend to the crow’s nest, their keen eyes
scanning the milk-white horizon. Distant sounds tantalize but remain
uncertain, ghosts of noise within the fog.</p>
<p>The Remorhaz tracks southwest, meticulously avoiding island channels.
Mera’s navigation is a dance of caution, each movement calculated to
preserve their safety.</p>
<p>By noon, the crew strains to discern waves against distant
shorelines, sound becoming their primary navigation tool. Stonebeard’s
call for ballista expertise finds Halite ready, positioning himself with
two other crew members, prepared for any potential threats.</p>
<p>They reduce speed, approaching with heightened vigilance. Then—a
bell, clear and sharp at first, then suddenly silenced.</p>
<p>Screams follow. Yelling. Shouted commands.</p>
<p>Sounds of crunching. Of cracking.</p>
<p>“Everyone! Eyes open!” Stonebeard roars.</p>
<p>Wreckage begins floating past—splintered wood, broken timbers. A
massive mast segment drifts into view, three desperate souls clinging to
its bulk.</p>
<p>And rising from the depths, a nightmare incarnate: a giant squid,
tentacles reaching hungrily toward the survivors.</p>
<p>The Frigid Depths have claimed another ship as victim— and the
Remorhaz stands between potential salvation and certain doom.</p>
<p>The battlefield erupts in a symphony of magical and martial action,
each crew member responding to the giant squid’s threat with their
unique talents.</p>
<p>Kragor chants arcane words, “Mactē virtutē”. As the last word is
uttered, a sudden chill surges through the air. A shimmering, icy aura
begins to emanate from his form, enveloping him in a protective shell of
frost. He then moves quickly to the ballista, grabs a large bolt, and
loads it. Scarlet then springs to the weapon, her aim sharp and focused
on the writhing tentacled horror.</p>
<p>While Scarlet tries to get a bead on the beast, a miraculous scene
unfolds near the wreckage: one of the shipwrecked survivors lifts his
companion, a ring sparkling eerily on his finger before he inexplicably
sprints across the water’s surface, defying natural law.</p>
<p>Elara, quick-witted and creative, strums her harp to conjure a minor
illusion— a tantalizing, hopefully seductive squid-form designed to
confuse their monstrous attacker. As the form fully materializes, her
harp strings continue to vibrate with an inspiring melody, empowering
Halite with courage and skill.</p>
<p>“Shoot the bastard!” bellows Captain Stonebeard, commanding the crew.
He raises his crossbow, but his shot goes wildly wide, sailing
harmlessly into the fog.</p>
<p>Doctor Pepe, steadier of hand, takes aim and strikes true. His bolt
finds purchase, drawing first blood and scoring a solid hit against the
creature.</p>
<p>“I’ll bring us broadside!” Mera shouts, maneuvering the ship to
attempt a rescue.</p>
<p>From below, Ingrid’s voice drifts up incongruously: “Anyone want a
sandwich?”</p>
<p>The squid, momentarily confused by Elara’s illusion, probes it with a
tentative appendage. Confused, it swings a large tentacle, but the
attack passes right through the squid-that-is-not-there. Finally
realizing the deception, it shifts focus and savagely attacks the boat,
its powerful beak tearing into the hull with devastating force.</p>
<p>Benefiting from the inspiration Elara granted earlier, Halite fires
the ballista, a devastating shot that tears into the squid’s massive
form. The bolt rips through its flesh, but the creature remains
terrifyingly active.</p>
<p>Whisper descends from the rigging to join the others on deck, and
throws her javelin with deadly precision. The creature writhes under the
assault but doesn’t slow.</p>
<p>“Two in the water!” Ironfist shouts, attempting to throw a rescue
rope to the figure strangely running across the water’s surface with
another slung over his shoulder. The rope falls pathetically short,
landing uselessly in the churning waves. Nonetheless, the water-walking
sailor closes the distance, and he and the companion he was carrying
clamber up the rope onto the deck. As soon as he steadies himself, his
eyes narrow, fixing on the squid with predatory intensity. A crimson
thread of arcane energy faintly traces a trail to his chosen prey,
marking it with an ethereal brand that he knows will make his every
subsequent strike deadly.</p>
<p>Another human suddenly materializes on deck, adding to the chaotic
battle… the third survivor of the shipwreck. By his garb, he is clearly
a wizard. “By the gods, I’m glad you showed up!” he shouts to the crew.
He reaches into his robes and pulls out a small dart along with
something slimy looking. He rubs them together and suddenly a sickly
shimmering green arrow streaks towards the squid. It lands just short of
the mark, yet it splashes and the squid flinches as its skin sizzles
where it is touched by the corrosive magic.</p>
<p>Kragor stands firm upon the wooden deck, veins throbbing with dark
energy. Sinister tendrils of unearthly mist coil and writhe from his
fingers, weaving through the air like serpents drawn to their prey. An
invisible curse ensnares the colossal squid, making its gaze falter, its
monstrous tentacles flinch with an unseen dread. “Dolor!” screams
Kragor, as a pulsating orb of crackling energy leaps from his war
hammer, tearing through the air with a piercing whistle. It collides
with the massive squid’s hide, the impact causing the creature to
recoil, its tentacles thrashing violently as the energy sizzles and
singes them.</p>
<p>Mera maneuvers the ship into a better firing position. Scarlet’s
slender fingers trace intricate patterns in the air, drawing forth a
mote of pure elemental fire that dances and trembles above her open
palm— a spark of primal energy, bright and hungry. With a fluid motion
born of wilderness training, she hurls the flame toward the squid’s
writhing mass, the blazing projectile arcing through salt-laden wind
before striking the creature’s membranous hide, erupting into a
consuming conflagration that sears and blisters its pallid flesh.</p>
<p><img src="remorhaz_route.jpg" /></p>
<p>“Get ready to aim and fire!” Captain Stonebeard bellows as he rapidly
reloads the ballista. In that fleeting moment, Doctor Pepe emerges like
a phantom, his crossbow bolt striking true into the squid’s vulnerable
flank. The beast roars in pain, its thick, dark flesh quivering from the
impact.</p>
<p>Enraged and wounded, the colossal squid reacts with malignant fury.
Its writhing tentacles thrash through the salt-laden air, and one
particularly vicious limb finds its mark on Elara, ensnaring her. Her
hands clutch at the slick, unyielding surface of the creature. The harp
at her side falls silent as she struggles, caught in the squid’s
vice-like grip.</p>
<p>Another abrupt strike from the squid’s beak leaves a gaping wound in
the ship’s hull. Thick splinters and dislodged timbers bear silent
witness to the beast’s brutal might. Amid the clamor of battle, Ingrid’s
voice wafts upward from below, barely registering over the cacophony of
combat: “Are you sure you wouldn’t like a sandwich?”</p>
<p>Halite’s broad arm hurls a javelin that whistles through the frigid
air, colliding with one of the squid’s thick tentacles. The impact
reverberates— a flash of victory as the creature recoils, wounded by the
force of his strike. At the same moment, Whisper dashes to Elara’s aid.
With feline agility, she slashes at the slimy appendage constricting
her, her claws raking into its flesh. A burst of raw determination
follows as she unleashes a flurry of attacks that loosen the tentacle’s
grip enough for Elara to breathe, but not enough for her to escape.</p>
<p>Across the chaotic deck, Ironfist steadies himself and lines up the
ballista, the massive weapon creaking as he aims it squarely at the
disordered beast. Not far away, the wiry wizard, face alight with fervor
and exhaustion, summons a bolt of shimmering blue energy. The air
crackles with ozone as a sustained electric arc connects with the squid,
sapping its monstrous vitality.</p>
<p>Kragor charges, hammer raised high in a wild swing, but his blow
misses, clanging uselessly against the ship’s railing. Scarlet seizes
the moment: she maneuvers nimble fingers over the ballista’s trigger,
and its bolt flies ahead, striking home into the beast’s pulsating flesh
with a resounding crash. Gerhard then finds his focus. His longbow sings
as an arrow arcs through the gloom, finding its target in one of the
squid’s unblinking eyes.</p>
<p>Under the relentless assault, the colossal creature falters, its
thrashing slowing until it releases Elara and finally sinks into the
inky depths. After a gasp of relief, Elara calls out over the din to
Ingrid below deck, her voice lilting and defiant, “Sandwiches for
everyone!” A surreal endnote to the turmoil— a promise of warmth and
camaraderie amid the unforgiving cold.</p>
<h2 id="gerhard">Gerhard</h2>
<p>The crew methodically surveys the damage. The squid’s beak has carved
a gaping maw in the ship’s hull, and the task of repair falls heavily on
the remaining hands.</p>
<p>Whisper, nimble even in the lingering fear, takes to the rigging,
aiding in the salvage operation. She peers into the depths, her vision
unnervingly clear, but the fog obscures the scene.</p>
<p>“Keep wits sharp and hearts steadfast,” the captain’s voice cuts
through the hush aboard the Remorhaz, a floating island of survival. On
decks slick with salt and battle-scraps, weary heroes meet the
newcomers: Gerhard, former captain of the lost ship; Rorik, his young
crewman; and Bret, a passenger.</p>
<p>“Well met,” Halite says, his voice crisp. “What brings you so far
out?”</p>
<p>Gerhard, weathered and mid-thirties, steps forward, brown eyes
reflecting relief and deep caution. “Thank you,” he breathes, voice
tight with gratitude and disbelief. “The Frostfang… my ship… gone. That
squid! I thought I was dead. Ran across the water, carrying Rorik. This
family heirloom saved me.” He gestures wildly. “And that aasimar… almost
killed! What the hell!”</p>
<p>Rorik, barely seventeen, watches his captain, wide-eyed. Halite,
however, stands rigid, scrutinizing Gerhard. Suspicion cuts sharper than
the chill air; Halite knows survivors don’t always bear honest
scars.</p>
<p>At the rail, Bret’s robed figure steps forward. Kragor recognizes the
sigils: a symbolic design of three inward-pointing diamond shapes with
eight curling spires underneath. This wizard is a member of the Cerberus
Assembly, a powerful conclave of mages in the Dwendalian Empire. The
wizard nods solemnly to Gerhard. “The sea tests us all,” Bret intones.
“Perhaps misfortune portends a greater journey.”</p>
<p>Halite’s gaze narrows on Gerhard, pressing. “Specifically, what were
you doing out here?”</p>
<p>Gerhard’s breath clouds the frigid air. “My kin have always plied
these waters. Fishing… crabbing, mostly.” He falters, eyes darting
across the ravaged deck. “But we found a new source of income. Ferrying
passengers, mostly one way to Eiselcross.” He gestures toward Bret.
“That mage offered a fortune in gold for his transport there and back
again.”</p>
<p>Bret stands nearby, clearly agitated, his words laced with a
demanding edge. “I require passage to Icehaven, Captain,” he declares,
his voice tight with urgency. “I bear tidings of utmost import. Our
vessel is lost; I must deliver my news without delay. I will provide
recompense for diverting your ship.”</p>
<p>Stonebeard remains unmoved. “Such a course is impossible,” he
rumbles, his voice a deep echo of the sea. “My obligations lie with the
Glassblades; my route must be followed. You may remain aboard. After
completing our appointed rounds, we shall deposit you at Palebank
Village. Another vessel can convey you to Icehaven from there. I am
heartened we rescued you, fortunate you remain living. But expect no
more than offered.” His gaze fixes upon the traveler with steely
resolve. “Assist cleaning the foredeck. There is work to be done.”</p>
<h2 id="land-ho">Land ho</h2>
<p>The afternoon fog clings suffocatingly to the Remorhaz, smothering
the sea and reducing the ship to a cautious crawl. In this soup, dead
reckoning is Mera’s only guide. Scarlet summons Sparky, her owl
companion, a flash of gold against the gray. “Fly up, Sparky,” she
commands, voice tight. “Find the sun. Tell me how long it takes. And
look for land.”</p>
<p>Sparky beats upward, swallowed instantly by the milky expanse. The
crew watches, hope and anxiety warring on their faces. Three minutes
pass. Four. The wingbeats fade into silence. Five minutes stretch into
six, then seven, then eight.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a spectral shape wheels out of the gray. Sparky circles,
settling onto Scarlet’s shoulder. The connection flares, and she sees
through the owl’s eyes. “Took a while to break through,” Scarlet
reports, her voice hushed, barely carrying over the creak of timbers.
“Up there… just clouds. A sea of gray, stretching forever. No land.”</p>
<p>A small, wry chuckle escapes her. “Sparky did mention seeing
tentacles in the water, though. Said they smelled bad… like farts.”</p>
<p>A collective sigh escapes the crew, a shared breath of weary
disappointment. Hope is a fragile commodity here. The Remorhaz creeps
onward, the search continuing within the fog’s suffocating embrace.</p>
<p>The galley bustles with activity, Chef Ingrid impressed with our tale
of the giant squid, her moon-and-rune amulet glinting in the lamplight.
Despite the chaos, a sense of camaraderie pulses through the ship as the
crew gathers— survivors and newcomers alike.</p>
<p>Kragor, brow furrowed, leans towards the wizard Bret, peppering him
with questions. Bret, clearly burdened by secrets, folds his hands
cautiously. “I am bound by oaths,” he states, his tone careful, “to
maintain discretion regarding my objectives within Eiselcross.” His eyes
dart around the galley.</p>
<p>Kragor persists. “But passage to Icehaven? You mentioned tidings of
utmost import. Surely, some details for fellow adventurers?”</p>
<p>Bret sighs, shoulders slumping. “We uncovered valuable information
and encountered… Aeorian constructs in the wastes. It is vital that I
reach Icehaven. And soon.”</p>
<p>“Seen any gold vials?” Kragor pushes, relentless.</p>
<p>Bret’s face remains impassive. “The antidote for the Frigid Woe?
No. Fortunately, we did not encounter that dreadful affliction.”</p>
<p>Sensing the rising tension, Elara raises her glass with a bright
smile. “To new beginnings,” she declares, her voice ringing with cheer,
“and to surviving giant squids!”</p>
<p>Laughter erupts, instantly easing the weight of suspicion. The crew
celebrates, reveling in their shared survival. Though fog still clings
thick to the Remorhaz outside, a warmth begins to bloom within the ship,
where adventurers share a meal among friends.</p>
<p>Below decks, Ingrid’s promised feast wafts upwards— smoked fish and
steaming bread, a comforting aroma cutting through the lingering brine
and stench left by their monstrous assailant. The three shipwreck
survivors— Gerhard, Rorik, and Bret— are formally integrated into the
temporary community forged by shared peril. Gerhard still looks stunned,
his eyes periodically flicking towards the deck as if expecting the
shattered Frostfang to reappear from the mist. Rorik, barely a man in
years, sticks close, while Bret, the wizard, observes the adventurers
with guarded curiosity.</p>
<p>Scarlet approaches Gerhard, her expression sympathetic but gaze
direct. “Gerhard, you said your family sailed these waters long? Your
family name?”</p>
<p>He pulls his attention from the grey void beyond the porthole.
“Eisner,” he replies, rubbing a hand over his burgeoning beard. “Of
Icehaven. Fishermen for generations. Crabs, mostly. That boat… she was
everything.” He gestures vaguely towards Rorik. “My life, his
livelihood… gone.” He sighs, a plume of condensation in the cool air.
“We’d only recently started ferrying passengers. Trying a new way. Bret
here offered good coin.”</p>
<p>“Is there somewhere… we might rest?” Gerhard asks, looking towards
Captain Stonebeard, who surveys the gathered company, his face grim but
resolute.</p>
<p>“Aye,” Stonebeard nods curtly. “Bunks enough. You earned your
place.”</p>
<p>As the survivors find spots at the galley table, laden with Ingrid’s
platters, conversation turns to the adventurers’ quest. Halite, Kragor,
and Elara briefly explain their mission: the Frigid Woe spreading from
Palebank Village, stolen Aeorian artifacts, Hulil’s desperation, and
their current journey to Eiselcross seeking the cure Elro described— the
milky liquid in golden vials. Gerhard and Rorik listen intently, their
own recent brush with death making the tale resonate deeply. Bret
listens too, his face impassive, betraying nothing.</p>
<p>Mera, the navigator, consults her charts, brow furrowed. “With this
fog and the delay… we lost time,” she announces. “But if the weather
clears, we could reach Syrinlya by tomorrow afternoon.”</p>
<p>A collective sigh ripples through the crew. Landfall is close.</p>
<p>Dinner is subdued, a recounting of the battle punctuated by shared
relief. Later, mugs refilled, Elara retrieves her harp. Small against
the vast, fog-bound sea, the instrument sings under her fingers, a
melody of quiet longing and resilient hope filling the galley. The notes
hang, fragile beauty against their harsh reality. Even Bret seems
softened, gaze distant. When the song ends, respectful silence yields to
appreciative murmurs.</p>
<p>As evening deepens, the ship’s routine returns. Watches are assigned:
Scarlet first, senses alert to wind and timber, Sparky a silent,
feathered presence beside her. Whisper follows, melting into deck
shadows, eyes piercing the gloom. Gerhard takes the third watch,
grateful for the normalcy. Captain Stonebeard joins him near the helm,
leaning on the rail, fog swirling like ghosts.</p>
<p>“Sorry about your vessel, Gerhard,” Stonebeard says, voice low. “Hard
thing, losing your ship.”</p>
<p>Gerhard nods, staring into the white abyss. “Aye. Good boat. Fast.
Grew up on her. Dad taught me fishing there.” He pauses. “Good thing I
have insurance.”</p>
<p>Stonebeard raises an eyebrow. “Insurance?”</p>
<p>“Aye. Have you never found a wizard willing to take a few gold a
month against the value of your hull? Got a good rate from an Empire
fellow. If she sinks, he buys me a new one. Family’s done it a long
time.” He shrugs. “Still… devastating. But we’re not bankrupt.”</p>
<p>Stonebeard grunts, filing the information away. “Boats are expensive.
Taken many voyages myself.” He shifts his weight. “Given the
circumstances, saving your lives, there’s no charge for passage to
Palebank Village.”</p>
<p>Gerhard turns, surprise, perhaps offense, flickering in his eyes. “No
charge? Captain, with respect, that’s naval etiquette. Rescued souls
aren’t passengers for fare.”</p>
<p>Stonebeard meets his gaze steadily. “My apologies. Correct, of
course. Force of habit.” He sighs wearily. “Long few days.” He gestures
vaguely below deck towards where Bret presumably sleeps. “That squid…
seemed focused. Like it was after your passenger.”</p>
<p>Gerhard shivers, though perhaps not entirely from the cold. “Never
seen the like. Thirty years sailing these waters. Seen krakens, sure.
But never one going after a ship, after someone, like that. Not even for
a hold full of my crabs.”</p>
<p>The two captains stand silent awhile, solitary figures keeping vigil
against the vast, uncaring sea and spectral fog.</p>
<p>Elara takes the fourth watch, relieving Gerhard. Settling near the
bow, harp resting beside her, she resolves to stay alert, but the
battle, the song, the journey’s weight… it all presses down. The
rhythmic slap of waves against the hull becomes a lullaby. Her eyelids
grow heavy. One moment she scans the impenetrable white wall ahead; the
next…</p>
<p>She jerks awake with a start. Grey dawn light filters through
thinning fog. Guilt floods her— she slept. Heart pounding, she scrambles
up, frantically scanning the deck, the sea. Nothing. No alarms, no
disturbances. The Remorhaz sails on, undisturbed. Relief wars with
embarrassment; apparently, the Frigid Depths granted her unguarded
peace.</p>
<p>As the morning progresses, the pale sun burns away the fog. By noon,
visibility stretches for ten miles across choppy, grey-green waves under
a brightening sky. And there, rising from the sea to the south, is the
unmistakable shape of land— jagged, snow-dusted peaks against the
horizon.</p>
<p>A shout goes up from the crow’s nest, echoed by murmurs on deck.
Captain Stonebeard strides to the railing, squinting. A rare grin splits
his beard. “Ah, Kaltsel to the south!” After a brief conference with the
navigator, he adds “Mera puts us two hours out from Syrinlya!” He turns,
voice booming across the deck, energized. “Alright, you lot! Look alive!
Pack your gear and prepare for landfall! The Frigid Depths haven’t
beaten us yet!”</p>
<p>The salt spray now freezes almost instantly upon hitting the deck.
Since leaving Palebank Village, the world has steadily bled color and
warmth, surrendering to an encroaching reign of ice. The air bites with
a ferocity that makes the fog-chilled waters seem almost temperate by
comparison. Under the finally clear, brittle sky, the Remorhaz glides
towards a coastline that looks like the jagged teeth of some immense,
frost-covered beast, its peaks clawing at the sky.</p>
<p>Mera’s calculations prove precise. As the sun begins its slow
descent, casting long, pale shadows across the waves, the ramshackle
outpost of Syrinlya comes into view. It’s less a town and more a
temporary scar upon the landscape— a sprawling camp of fur-lined yurts
huddled against the relentless wind, smoke whipping horizontally from
their capped peaks. Figures bundled against the cold— mostly dwarves and
elves, judging by their builds— move between the structures.</p>
<p>Stonebeard brings the Remorhaz expertly alongside a crude dock
fashioned from timber and ice. “Alright, Syrinlya!” he bellows, his
voice carrying over the wind’s howl. “We’ll unload cargo, then take on
whatever’s heading back south. We depart for Palebank Village in three
days. Plenty of time for you lot to find your contact.” He gives a curt
nod to the adventurers. “Mind the ice.”</p>
<h2 id="syrinlya">Syrinlya</h2>
<p>The wind assaults the party as they step onto frozen ground, driving
needles of snow into exposed skin. Kragor pulls his cloak tighter,
muttering about unnatural cold. A stout, weathered dwarf woman with a
wild mane of shaggy grey hair approaches, stamping heavily booted
feet.</p>
<p>“Morgo Delwur, at yer service!” she declares, her voice rasping
through the gale. “Heard you were comin’. Lookin’ for Orvo Mustave?” She
gestures vaguely inland. “His yurt’s over there. And the Buyer?” She
points to a larger, well-maintained yurt. “That’s his place. Fancy.”</p>
<p>She sweeps an arm around the disparate groups of adventurers milling
about near sputtering fires. “Everyone’s here for the same thing, eh?
Aeorian treasure. Big risks, big rewards… or just frozen toes.”</p>
<p>Halite asks, “Can you point us towards provisions? Snowshoes,
perhaps?”</p>
<p>Morgo nods. “Aye, plenty o’ folk lookin’ to sell you gear. Some make
more coin tradin’ than diggin’. Follow me.” She leads them through the
camp to another large, fur-lined yurt. “You can bunk here. Belonged to
some rich elf lordling. Came lookin’ for adventure, poor sod. Got
himself eaten by a sabre-tooth tiger his first day out.”</p>
<p>Scarlet’s eyes widen. “In the yurt?!”</p>
<p>“Gods, no, lass!” Morgo barks a laugh. “We don’t let the big cats
wander camp! Nah, he went out, didn’t listen to his guides. They found
his boots and… well, not much else. His loss, your gain.”</p>
<p>Inside, the yurt is surprisingly spacious and less frigid. A stone
fire pit sits centrally; thick, fur-lined hammocks hang from sturdy
poles. “Right then,” Scarlet steps to the pit, whispers an incantation.
A small flame springs to life, instantly pushing back the chill.</p>
<p>Gerhard, utterly lost and overwhelmed, drifts away from the nascent
fire, staring blankly at a fur-lined wall. Elara approaches the bereaved
captain. “Gerhard,” she says softly, her voice warm despite the chill.
“It’s… a lot to take in. But you’re safe now.”</p>
<p>Scarlet steps closer to the crackling flames. “She’s right. You
survived something terrible. You’re stronger than you think. And you’re
welcome here.”</p>
<p>He manages a weak, haunted smile. “Thank you… my boat… everything…”
Rubbing his face, he trails off. “I… I think I need rest.” He finds an
unoccupied hammock and climbs in, pulling a fur blanket over
himself.</p>
<p>While Gerhard settles, Kragor spots an open wooden crate. Curiosity
piqued, he investigates. Inside lies a trove: weeks of trail rations,
fifty feet of fine silk rope, a thick woolen blanket, another grappling
hook, a sturdy miner’s pick, and, tucked beneath it all, a small,
leather-bound book.</p>
<p>Kragor picks it up. The gold-leaf title reads: “Adventure Sexy:
Impress Potential Lovers with Great Deeds”, by Scanlan Shorthalt.</p>
<p>He grunts, holding it aloft. “Looks like our elf wasn’t just after
treasure.”</p>
<p>Elara peers at it. “Oh, Scanlan again. So popular… I’ll have a
following like that someday.” She winks.</p>
<p>Whisper sniffs disdainfully. “More useful than poetry, perhaps,” she
eyes the silk rope with interest.</p>
<p>“Miner’s pick?” Halite rumbles, taking the tool from the crate and
testing its weight. “Could be useful.”</p>
<p>Morgo nods at the fire. “Right then. Shelter’s sorted. Provisions are
sold near The Buyer’s place. Meself, I’ll be heading on an expedition
west tomorrow.” She cracks her knuckles. “Any final questions?”</p>
<p>“Thank you for your hospitality, Morgo,” Halite says with a
respectful nod.</p>
<p>“Aye, thanks for the yurt,” Kragor adds, tossing the Scanlan
Shorthalt book dismissively into its crate. Elara quickly retrieves it
with a thoughtful hum.</p>
<p>Morgo gives them a final nod. “Stay warm. Stay sharp. Don’t get
eaten.” She turns and vanishes into the swirling snow.</p>
<p>Inside the yurt, the fire crackles against the wind’s mournful
Eiselcross howl. It’s late afternoon, their fifth day since leaving
Palebank Village. Syrinlya is harsh, potentially deadly, but they have
shelter, supplies, and a lead.</p>
<h2 id="orvo">Orvo</h2>
<p>“Alright,” Halite says, hefting the miner’s pick. “Let’s find this
Orvo Mustave. Then we’ll see about snowshoes and other provisions.”</p>
<p>Whisper interjects, “It’s getting late. Best split up: some get
supplies, others find Orvo.”</p>
<p>They agree. Whisper, Scarlet, and Doctor Pepe head for the provision
yurts near The Buyer’s large dwelling, the spot Morgo indicated. Wind
tugs their cloaks as they navigate snow-dusted paths between
structures.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Kragor, Halite, Elara, and a subdued Gerhard seek Orvo
Mustave’s yurt. They find it slightly apart, smaller than theirs, smoke
rising bravely against the grey sky. Before it, a modest campfire
struggles against the cold. A young dwarf sits beside the flames,
shortsword across his lap. His dark, relatively short beard frames a
face marked by a prominent scar— three ragged lines, like a claw mark
dragged across his cheek. He looks up as they approach, warming his
hands.</p>
<p>“Oh, hey,” he calls out, his voice rough but friendly enough. “How
y’all doing?”</p>
<p>Halite steps forward, his bulk casting a long shadow in the afternoon
light. “Well met. We seek Orvo Mustave. Elro of the Glassblades sent us
from Palebank Village.”</p>
<p>The dwarf nods, pushing himself up slightly from his resting spot.
“I’m Orvo. Elro sent word you’d be coming. Heard you came with the
Remorhaz.” He squints at the disparate group before him. “Quite the
collection. Where are you folks from?”</p>
<p>Kragor pulls his cloak tighter against the wind whipping off the ice.
“Bladegarden.”</p>
<p>Orvo whistles softly. “Bladegarden? Long way. Caught between the
Empire and the Dynasty there, eh?”</p>
<p>Halite gestures vaguely south. “The Menagerie Coast is my home.”</p>
<p>“Ah, the Menagerie,” Orvo nods. “Heard it’s warmer.” He turns his
gaze to Elara, who beams, her celestial heritage almost palpable even
bundled in furs. “And you, lass?”</p>
<p>Elara steps forward, eyes sparkling like distant stars. “Me? Oh, I’m
from the stars! Just landed here recently.”</p>
<p>Orvo blinks, then chuckles, a low rumble in his chest. “From the
stars, eh? Okay then. That’s… different. Welcome to Syrinlya,
Star-Lass.” His gaze shifts to Gerhard, who seems braced for the
attention.</p>
<p>Gerhard clears his throat, his voice quiet, almost rough from disuse
or emotion. “Gerhard Eisner. My family… we’re from the Greying
Wildlands, north of the Empire. We… fished these waters. Generations of
us.” He gestures vaguely out towards the frozen sea, his expression
momentarily shadowed by unspoken loss.</p>
<p>Orvo nods slowly, his expression softening with understanding.
“Greying Wildlands? Know the coast. Tough folk live up there. And
fishing these waters… takes grit.” Sensing Gerhard’s recent hardship, he
doesn’t press, turning back to the group. “Well, welcome to Syrinlya.
You all came a long way. What can I do for you? Elro’s message just said
you were looking for something.”</p>
<p>Elara clasps her hands together. “We are on a quest! A most urgent
one. We seek… a cure! A milky liquid, held within vials of gold. Have
you seen such wonders?”</p>
<p>Orvo scratches his scarred cheek, looking genuinely puzzled. “Gold
vials? Milky liquid? Can’t say I have. Sounds fancy.”</p>
<p>“Familiar with the Frigid Woe?” Halite asks directly, his tone sharp.
“The freezing sickness?”</p>
<p>Orvo’s expression darkens. “Aye. Nasty business. Came across the…
source material… out with Urgon.” He pauses, brow furrowed. “Wait, you
know Urgon? My buddy?”</p>
<p>Kragor steps forward, switching smoothly to Dwarvish, his voice low
and somber. “Orvo… we have bad news about Urgon.”</p>
<p>Orvo’s eyes widen slightly. “Bad news? What… what happened?”</p>
<p>“He contracted the Frigid Woe,” Kragor states plainly. “From one of
the blue vials you recovered. He… did not survive. Died back in Palebank
Village.”</p>
<p>The dwarf stares, comprehension dawning slowly. His gaze drops to the
struggling fire; he kicks absently at a chunk of ice near his boot. “Ah,
hells. Urgon…” He shakes his head, the movement sluggish with disbelief.
“Damn it. Knew that stuff was dangerous. He… could be a real jerk, but…
he was my mate.” Looking up, grief and anger cloud his eyes. He switches
back to Common, his voice thick. “That bloody sickness. Did… did you
handle those blue vials?”</p>
<p>“We secured the ones Hulil Lutan had,” Halite confirms. “She got them
from Urgon, it seems. Did you keep any?”</p>
<p>Orvo shakes his head again. “Nah. Sold my share to The Buyer right
after the dig. Needed coin. Told Urgon to be careful.” He sighs, a
ragged sound. “So the cure… the gold vials you’re after… you think
they’re out where we found the blue ones?”</p>
<p>“Elro believes so,” Elara confirms urgently. “Where did you find
them, Orvo? People are still sick back in Palebank Village.”</p>
<p>“Right, right.” Orvo gathers his thoughts. “The place is called
Salsvault.” He gestures northwest. “About two hundred miles that way, in
the Thin Sheets. The ice there gets treacherous, shifting. The ruin
itself is… odd. Better shape than most. Feels like something’s holding
it together, maybe magic from the city’s fall.”</p>
<p>“Two hundred miles?” Kragor’s brow creases as he calculates. “How
long does that take?”</p>
<p>“Depends on your pace,” Orvo replies. “Normal speed, maybe eight or
nine days— twenty-four miles a day, give or take. Push it to thirty, but
you risk exhaustion. Or slow it down, safer at eighteen miles a day,
easier to spot trouble.” He rubs his hands near the fire. “Trouble like
the Ice Mephits. Elemental pests drawn to the magic keeping the place
intact.”</p>
<p>“Mephits?” Elara asks, intrigued. “Are they aggressive?”</p>
<p>“Oh aye,” Orvo nods grimly. “Saw a few lurking outside. We thought we
were clever sneaking past them. The real trouble was inside. Looked like
a lab. We barely made it into the third chamber before these animated
suits of armor came alive and chased us out. Not as big as you,” he
glances at Halite, “but still big enough. We snatched what we could— the
vials and a few other bits— and didn’t look back.”</p>
<p>“So you didn’t find any gold vials?” Halite presses.</p>
<p>“Nah. Didn’t know what the blue ones held then, just that they seemed
valuable.” Orvo sighs, regret heavy in his voice. “Poor Urgon. If I’d
known…”</p>
<p>“Is there no faster way to Salsvault?” Kragor asks. “Horses? Sled
dogs?”</p>
<p>Orvo snorts. “Horses? They’d freeze or break a leg in an hour. Dogs,
maybe, if you find a trained team willing to risk it. Most folks stick
to snowshoes. Best bet, really.”</p>
<p>“Where can we acquire those?” Halite asks.</p>
<p>“No proper shops here,” Orvo confirms. “It’s all trade and salvage.
Folks pick gear off expeditions that… don’t come back complete. Try
asking around near The Buyer’s yurt. Fellow named Javel, might have
some. Three yurts over from the big one, towards the ice cliffs. But
expect to pay. Supply and demand, eh? Probably run you two gold a pair,
maybe more if he thinks you’re desperate.”</p>
<p>As Orvo finishes speaking, the rest of the party approaches, emerging
from the maze of yurts. Scarlet brushes snow from her cloak, Whisper
moves with silent steps, and Doctor Pepe offers a curt nod.</p>
<p>“We struck out on supplies,” Scarlet admits reluctantly. “However!”
she holds up a small, grease-stained paper bag. “Scones. Apparently,
someone here bakes.”</p>
<p>Doctor Pepe eyes the bag. “Are they gluten-free?”</p>
<p>“They’re squid-based,” Whisper announces, her voice flat but her eyes
betraying an eagerness to try them.</p>
<p>Orvo looks between the two groups, then back towards the bleak,
frozen wilderness stretching away to the northwest. “Right then. Looks
like you’re all set to talk gear. Salsvault ain’t goin’ anywhere. But
those suits of armor… watch yourselves. They freaked me right out.” He
gives them a final, weary nod. “Good luck. Hope you find what you’re
lookin’ for. For Urgon’s sake, too.”</p>
<p>The wind howls a dirge through Syrinlya’s haphazard sprawl of yurts
as the reunited party stands outside Orvo Mustave’s modest dwelling. The
dwarf offers a weary nod before retreating to the warmth of his fire,
leaving the adventurers to the biting cold. Snow swirls around their
boots, stinging exposed cheeks.</p>
<h2 id="javel">Javel</h2>
<p>“Right,” Halite rumbles. “Snowshoes. Orvo mentioned a trader named
Javel, three yurts over from The Buyer’s place.”</p>
<p>Whisper nods, her tail twitching beneath her cloak. “Near the ice
cliffs. Let’s not waste time.”</p>
<p>They trudge through the deepening snow, the crunch of their boots
muffled by the wind. Bundled figures pass by, faces obscured by scarves,
gazes cast downward against the elements. The air smells sharp and cold.
Gerhard follows silently, haunted by memories of his lost ship.</p>
<p>Following Orvo’s directions, they locate the specified yurt—a larger
structure with smoke curling from its central vent. A rough-hewn sign
hangs beside the entrance, depicting a crossed pickaxe and snowshoe.</p>
<p>Elara, ever the diplomat, pushes the flap aside and steps inside, the
others close behind. The immediate change is palpable; the wind’s roar
diminishes, and though the air is cold, it lacks the vicious bite of
outside. The interior is cluttered yet organized, filled with furs,
ropes, and adventuring gear. Near a sputtering fire pit sits a dwarf so
ancient his braided beard pools around his feet. He looks up, watery
eyes blinking in the gloom, and lets out a series of rattling
coughs.</p>
<p>“Good day, Master Dwarf! I’ve heard good things about your shop.”
Elara chirps, her voice bright in the dim, smoky yurt. She steps
forward, radiating warmth despite the chill. The old dwarf squints at
her.</p>
<p>“Eh? What’s this now?” he rasps. “Well now… yer a sight. What in the
Nine Hells are ya? Is that… a horn on yer head?”</p>
<p>Elara smiles, a dimple appearing in her cheek. “Some say it’s
horny.”</p>
<p>The dwarf lets out a wheezing cough that could be a chuckle. “Heh.
What can I do for ya?”</p>
<p>“We’re new here,” Elara says, pulling a small, worn leather-bound
book from her pack. “Hoping you might help us. By the way, your cough
sounds dreadful. I don’t have any herbs, but I find this book helps
during… downtime.” She offers it to him.</p>
<p>The dwarf’s eyes widen slightly as he takes the book with a trembling
hand. “Tusk Love? Gods… have ya read Chapter Three?”</p>
<p>“Oh, it was so good,” Elara gushes, clasping her hands. “The size of
those hands! And the tentacles! My horn was horny when I read that
chapter!”</p>
<p>“Aye!” The dwarf nods vigorously, another cough rattling him. “Best
thing to read when yer laid up. Just lay back and read Tusk Love.” He
sets the book aside and pulls out a long pipe, tamping something into
the bowl. “A woman after me own heart. So, what brings this fine company
to ol’ Javel’s Emporium? I’d guess me boyish good looks, or yer lookin’
for gear.”</p>
<p>“Well,” Elara leans in conspiratorially, “we definitely noticed the
boyish good looks.”</p>
<p>“Ho ho!” Javel chuckles, a sound like rocks tumbling. “Yer not wrong
there! But I suspect gear’s the main order o’ business. What do ye need?
Snowshoes?”</p>
<p>“Indeed,” Halite confirms. “Seven pairs. We’re on an urgent
mission—to stop a… popsicle sickness.”</p>
<p>Javel raises an eyebrow. “Popsicle sickness? Ah, the Frigid Woe.
Nasty business. Commendable you want to stop it.” He studies the party.
“Goliath, Tabaxi, Orc, Halfling… you lot come in all shapes, eh? Let me
see what I got.” With a groan, he rises, his beard trailing the
packed-earth floor, and disappears into the shadows of the yurt.</p>
<p>They hear him muttering, coughing, and the unmistakable shuffle of
gear, occasionally interrupted by a clatter and a dwarven curse. Halite
shifts his weight, scanning the yurt’s contents. His thoughts drift
beyond the immediate dangers of Salsvault— Eiselcross, Aeor… ancient
magic, lost knowledge. Perhaps there are secrets here beyond just a
cure. A seed of ambition takes root: survive this, find the cure, yes,
but also learn. Bring back more than just stories to his people.</p>
<p>Javel reappears, dragging several pairs of snowshoes. “Right then.
Got yer sizes, I reckon.” He sorts through them. “Goliath… these’ll do.”
He tosses a large pair towards Halite. “Orc, Tabaxi, the rest of ya. Oh
and erm, Halfling…” He pauses, holding up a pair stained dark red. He
glances at Scarlet. “Yours… uh… well, they’re red. Ignore that.”</p>
<p>He piles the seven pairs together. “Normally, fifteen gold for the
lot. But… I like yer horn, lass. And yer taste in literature.” He winks
at Elara. “Twelve gold pieces for the lot. That’s like getting three
pairs free, considerin’ the goliath tax.”</p>
<p>“How about ten gold?” Elara counters smoothly. “Chapter Eight was
quite illuminating. Those pixies! Glitter me, that’s all I have to
say.”</p>
<p>Javel strokes his beard, considering. Elara beams hopefully. He
shakes his head. “Twelve’s fair. But… seein’ as yer on a noble quest…”
He rummages behind a pile of furs. “I’ll throw in these four ice hammers
… and,” he holds up a finger indicating a pause, and rummages around. He
then produces a few sturdy climbing hammers along with a quartet of
waxed leather pouches, each roughly the size of a grown man’s fist. “…
Oil. That’s a whole lot— seven pairs o’ shoes, four hammers, four pounds
of oil— thirteen gold pieces. Final offer. Won’t find better in
Syrinlya, guaranteed.”</p>
<p>Scarlet steps closer, eyeing the red snowshoes Javel set aside. In
Dwarvish, she asks, “Why are the snowshoes red?”</p>
<p>Javel leans in, lowering his voice. “Ah. Pre-owned, ye see. Prime
condition, but… belonged to a halfling.”</p>
<p>“And the color?” Kragor interjects.</p>
<p>Javel glances at the yurt flap, conspiratorial. “Keep yer eyes open
for Yetis out there.”</p>
<p>“Are they partial to halflings?” Scarlet asks dryly.</p>
<p>“Depends how hungry they are,” Javel grunts. “But the red… aye.
That’s bloodstain. Couldn’t quite scrub it all out.”</p>
<p>Nearby, Gerhard listens in on the Dwarvish conversation, and
summarizes for Halite in a murmur, “Sounds like a Yeti ate the last
owner.”</p>
<p>Scarlet inspects the snowshoes more closely. Years of reading
nature’s signs allow her to identify the stains with chilling certainty.
It’s old blood, soaked deep into the hide. She wrinkles her nose but
nods. “They’ll do. Thirteen gold.”</p>
<p>As the party pools their coins, Javel grunts with satisfaction,
tucking the gold into a pouch. “Pleasure doin’ business with ya.” He
reaches under some furs and pulls out a dusty bottle of amber liquid.
“And before ye go… welcome to Syrinlya.” He hands it to Elara. “On the
house. Sandkeg’s High. Not the fancy stuff, but it’ll warm yer
bones.”</p>
<p>“Why thank you, generous soul!” Elara replies, taking the
whiskey.</p>
<p>“Right then,” Kragor says, eyeing the bottle. “After fighting a giant
squid and learning we’re facing an eight-day trek through Yeti
territory, I think a drink’s in order.”</p>
<p>“Agreed,” Halite nods. “Let’s head back to the yurt. We need to
plan.”</p>
<p>They thank Javel and step out into the relentless wind, clutching
their new gear. The evening sky darkens, the cold deepening as the
prospect of their journey looms large. Back at the elf-lord’s abandoned
yurt, with Gerhard huddled miserably in a hammock and the whiskey making
the rounds, they face the stark reality of Eiselcross. They have gear
and a destination, but the path ahead is long, cold, and fraught with
unknown perils.</p>
