# 2025-04-13 — Dungeons and Gardens

The sea we are crossing are the Frigid Depths.
It is incredibly thick fog, visibility 50'.

Halite has some insight into himself, and interest in the Weave. He wants to bring this knowledge back to his people.

Waking up on day 4. Chef Ingrid cooks a huge breakfast in gratitude for helping.

She pulls Whisper aside. "sorry abou the little nip. in that form it is hard to control. i like to chase cats." She offers Whisper poke, a special dish.

Captain Stonebeard says "we need all eyes on deck". they clang the bell indicating the ships location to others on the sea.
"passengers, keep your eyes over the rail, avoid collisions."

Hador and Whisper go up in the rigging, to the crow’s nest.

We think we might hear other bells, but can’t be sure.

The boat goes south and west, avoiding other islands. Stonebeard says we are not going to cut the channel too close.

About noon, we’re trying to hear whether there are waves against the shore.

Stonebeard asks who has experience with ballista. Halite has, and will man the ballista with two others.

We go to half mast, approaching slowly.
We now are sure we hear a bell— that suddenly stops.
Followed by screaming, yelling, commands be shouted.
Crunching and cracking.
Feels like it is straight ahead on port side.

Stonebeard: “Everyone! Eyes open!”

We see pieces of wood and wreckage floating by.
Also what looks to be a big chunk of a main mast with three clinging to it.
A giant squid is reaching up to them.

Kragor casts AoA and loads the ballista.
Scarlet runs up to the ballista and aims it at the squid.

One of the humans on the main mast in the water picks up his crew mate, his ring twinkles, and then RUNS ACROSS the water.

Elara casts minor illusion of another squid, this one a sexy squid to distract the attacking squid. The plays her harp to inspire Halite.

Stonebeard commands the crew to fire at the squid.
Then pulls out a crossbow to fire at the squid, and misses by a mile.

Doctor Pepe pulls out his crossbow and fires, and draws first blood. 5 points of damage.

Mara yells: I will turn the boat broadside so we can pick them up!

Ingrid calls up from the galley, “Are you alright up there? Does anyone need a sandwich?”

The squid explores the illusion with one tentacle which passes through it; still unsure, it takes a second swipe and finally figures out that it is an illusion. It then moves to the boat and bites it for 20 points of damage.

The human wizard misty steps onto the boat.

Halite fires the ballista and expends his bardic inspiration, hitting the squid for 12 points of damage. The squid is not slowing down.

Whisper unties herself from the mast and heads down to the deck. She throws a javelin into the squid for 7 points of damage.

Ironfist yells "we have two in the water" and throws a tries to throw a rope to the humans. It falls about 10' short.

The wizard pulls out something slimy from his component pouch and rubs it on a dart. A sickly green arrow shoots from his finger towards the squid. It misses, but some of the acid splashes the squid. "not bad damage"

Kragor hexes the squid and fires at the squid for 13 points of damage. The squid is starting to show some wear.

Mara gets us broadside the squid.

Scarlet casts Produce Flame and hurls it at the squid, hitting for 5 points.

The human and the crew mate he is carrying clambor onto the deck, then casts Hunter’s Mark on the squid. (I guess he is a Ranger.)

Elara pulls out her shortbow and fires, but the rocking of the boat messes with her aim and she misses.

Captain Stonebeard says "mera, turn around!" He loads the ballista.

Doctor Pepe sneak attacks with his crossbow and hits for 18 points of damage.

The squid is very hurt and angry. The squid swipes at Kragor and misses. It then swings at Elara, hitting for 11 damage and grappling her. Finally it bites the hull for 21 damage. This ship starts to slow.

Ingrid offers sandwiches again.

Halite throws a javelin at the squid hitting in for 9 damage.

Whisper rushes over to Elara and attacks the tentacle grappling her. 9 points of damage with her first punch. Flurry of claws next for 9 points more of damage. The tentacle loosens Elara a little but not enough for her to get away.

Ironfist aims the ballista at the squid.

The wizard fires a beam of blue energy towards the creature (Witch Bolt). The smell of ozone fills the air as the bolt connects, doing 5 points of damage.

Kragor swings his hammer wildly at the tentacle and misses.

Scarlet fires the ballista hitting the squid for 17 damage. The squid thrashes in pain.

The human ranger shoots at the squid with his longbow, hitting it in the eye for 8 points of damage. Elara feels the tentacle loosens and drops away. The squid sinks into the ocean.

Elara calls to Ingrid: Sandwiches for Everyone!

A 17 year old crew member carried on by the human ranger.
A wizard robed with Cerberus Assembly.
The other human, lithe, mid 30s, weathered from being on the sea, brown hair unkempt, beard, brown eyes introduces himself as Gerhard.
"thank you for being here. my family’s boat Frost Fang is now gone.
this is crazy, i ran across water with this family heirloom,
that bard almost got killed, what the hell!"

Halite was looking for any deceit from this new guy.
He is not as unfamiliar with danger as he is letting on,
clearly been in these waters for some time.

My family ferry’s one way and fishes the other way. Lots of demand to travel to Eiselcross.

the wizard (Bret) addresses Captain Stonebeard. speaking politely but aggressively. i need to be taken back to Icehaven. i will pay to divert.
Stonebeard is politely declining.
Whisper overhears this conversation.
stonebeard says, you can ride with us and then catch a boat out of palebank village. i work for the glassblades and will finish my rounds. you shouldn’t ask for anymore.
he asks bret to help clean up.

it is now afternoon, still foggy. the boat is going slow, because we have lost track of dead reckoning.

Scarlet asks her owl (Sparky) to fly up and have a look around. Find land.
The owl flies for eight minutes. A couple of times we hear its feathers flapping.
Sparky is about 100' astern of the boat when it reconnects with Scarlet.
It took quite a while to get above the fog, and could not see any further.

its now dinner time. Ingrid is impressed with our tail of the squid.
we are all together now. kragor starts peppering the wizard with questions.
"we are not allowed to talk about what we are finding there but we have made progress in some our camps. we ran into some aeorian constructs. im going back to the empire to get reinforcements. king grendle wants to know personally what we're up to."
"have you seen any gold vials by chance"
"i assume you mean the antidote for the frigid woe? we have not. we are fortunate to miss it."

scarlet asks about gerhardt. what is your background? family name? "Eisners of Icehaven." fishing family, lots of boats. that was my life and everything that sank. we have started ferrying one way. crab fishing.

gerhard asks if there is some place to sleep. captain stonebeard says yep, we have a bunk. we bring gerhard up to date on our story.

mara says we should get there tomorrow. we were making good time before that squid.

elara plays an after dinner melody. "sailing."

scarlet takes first watch. whisper take the second watches. gerhard takes the third watch, and captain stonebeard joins him.
stonebeard says he is sorry about losing the boat. gerhard talks insurance.
stonebeard says no charge on the fare, and gerhard is offended— that should be a given.
stonebeard apologizes but is firm.
more chatter: the squid seems to have been going after the wizard.
gerhard: they have never come across these again. in 30 years, never seen it go after someone like that, not even my crabs.

elara takes the next watch. but, she wakes up at dawn. good thing nothing happened.

the sun comes up. about 10am the fog starts burning off. by noon we can see, visibility 10 miles. we can see an island to the south.
captain stonebeard says "great, two hours to get there! pack up!"

we will land at syrinlya, unload and load the ship, and head back in three days.

we prepare to disembark.

kragor asks about "the buyer". stonebeard explains where to find him. yurt.

we arrive in the port of syrinlya.
since we left palebank village it has been getting colder.
yurts in a camp.
dwarves and elves.

a shaggy maned dwarf introduces herself, "so-and-so at your service."
morgor dowar.
"got a message about you coming
and i will show you around."
how can we find orvo mustave?
he’s down that way,
and the buyer is that really nice yurt.
she shows us all the adventurers about town looking for treasures.

she takes us to a rather large furlined yurt and offers, "you all can stay here." this rich foolish elf so-and-so got eaten by a sabre tooth tiger. scarlet, "in the yurt??” no honey we don’t let them in town.
that was his first day of his first expedition and he didn’t listen to the guides.

whisper asks "other guides?"
morgo says "oh yeah we have everything."

gerhard feels out of place with the party.
scarlet and elara improve his mood.
the yurt is nice, there’s a firepit, which scarlet starts with her cantrip.
we can all sleep here, crowded.

kragor sees an open crate with 50 days of rations, 50 ft of silk rope, a blanket, another grappling hook, a miner’s pick, a book titled “adventurer sexy,impress potential lovers with great deeds—scanlon shorthalt”.
morgo says got any more questions? leaving in the morning. we’re gonna go up west looking for stuff.

kragor, halite, elara, and gerhardt go to orvo's place. he is one of the outer yurts. campfire out front. small tent. there is a young dwarf, with a facial scar like a large claw, shortsword across his lap, warming his hands in front of the fire.
it is orvo.
we discuss where each of us is from:

- kragor: bladegarden
- goliath: menagerie coast
- elara: orvo is enchanted, she says she is from the stars

elara explains the we’re after the special gold vials. orvo is not sure what she it talking about. halite explains.
with urgon, we found it on the ?
i sold mine to the buyer.
kragor gives the bad news about urgon to orvo.
that is terrible. is was kind of a jerk but my buddy.
orvo knows about that sickness. we are out of antidote as far as i know.
salsvault is about 200 miles northwest, the thin sheets.
it is a region with thin ice.
the ruin must have something preserving it.
it is like the mages tried to keep the whole thing together during the calamity.
kragor asks how long it would take to get there. it’ll be like 9 days.

30/miles fast.
24/miles normal.
18/miles slow.

something about the magic there attracks ice mephits.
it appeared to be a lab. we only made it to three chambers before suits of armor chased us out.
we booked it out of there.

elara asks, "how did you get around the mephits?" orvo: "we stealthed around them." we kind of freaked out thinking we were alright, then this suit of armor came at is.

"i didn’t know what was in the vials, poor urgon, i liked him a lot, even tho he was a dick"

he recommends snowshoes. there arent stores. but folks have stuff for sale, like Javel.
kragor wonders what the going rate is. 2gp a pair, due to supply/demand.

scarlet and whisper catch up with scones.

we head to the other yurt. we meet a very old dwarf.
he sees Elara and wonders what she is.
elara offers tusk love as a gift.
"oh yeah, have you read chapter 3!?"
they rave about tusk love.

"either you are here for my boyish good looks or for gear"
elara flirts, boyish good looks.
he looks at the halfling and the goliath: "let me see if i have your size"

we hear a lot of coughing and moving around equipment.
"i have’m your size."
he looks at Scarlet, "uh, yeah, your’s are red. ignore that."
"i like you, so the whole lot for 12 gp."
and you seem like nice folks, so I’m gonna give you these four ice hammers for 13 gp.

scarlet asks in dwarvish, "why did you point out this is red?" "previously owned." "what’s the story?" "well he is some advice. keep your eyes open for yeti." "do they really like halflings or what?" "depends how hungry they are."

gerhardt "what do yeti have to do with the red?" "basically blood stains."

the party buys them for 13 gp.

the dwarf offers a bottle of whiskey, "sandkeg's high".

kragor suggests we all get a drink.
