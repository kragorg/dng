<h1 id="ferol-sal">Ferol Sal</h1>
<p><span class="dropcap">The sound is a dead, fleshy</span> thing. Not
the sharp crack of a hammer, but a wet, heavy punctuation to the tomb’s
deep silence. <em>Thump. Thump. Thump.</em> It comes from a door down
the hall, painted a flaking blood-red, a crude white “X” scrawled across
its center.</p>
<p>“Well,” Doctor Pepe whispers, “that’s not ominous at all.” He starts
toward it, a moth to a very ugly flame. The rest of the party stays
behind in the forge, awaiting Doctor Pepe’s signals.</p>
<p>Kragor grunts. “Looks like he has chosen the door with the warning,
Gerhard.”</p>
<p>The ranger shifts his weight, positioning himself in the forge’s
doorway. “Aye. You want to maybe get behind him in case something really
bad happens? I can hide behind you.”</p>
<p>“Let him learn his lesson,” Kragor rumbles, not unkindly.</p>
<p>Amused, Gerhard quietly moves into the hallway and takes position,
ready to shoot any horror that should come into view.</p>
<p>Doctor Pepe, oblivious, is already at work. He kneels, his tools a
silver glint in the arcane light. He listens, probes, and after a
moment, gives a confident nod. A <em>click</em> echoes down the
hall.</p>
<p>The thumping inside pauses. Then resumes, heavier, more frantic.</p>
<p>Doctor Pepe places his hand on the door, intending to crack it just
an inch. He rolls his wrist. He fumbles. The door swings wide open with
a groan.</p>
<p>The room beyond is a debris-filled mess. A creature, nearly nine feet
tall—a grotesque parody of a man sewn from the mismatched parts of
others—turns from its work of hammering a table into shards. It looks at
the rogue, its dead eyes fixing on him, and charges.</p>
<p>Startled, Pepe scrambles back, trips, and falls over the threshold
into the room.</p>
<p>Seeing the blunder from his vantage point in the forge doorway,
Kragor roars, “By Kord’s broken shield!”</p>
<p>As the flesh golem reaches him, Doctor Pepe expertly regains his
footing. He darts and slashes, but the monster hardly notices. He bolts
back into the hallway as his companions’ arrows and javelins sink into
the creature’s hide, mere annoyances.</p>
<p>A fist the size of a small boulder comes down. The rogue’s ribs give
way with a sound like snapping branches. A second blow hammers the air
from his lungs, and he collapses, a broken marionette.</p>
<p>“Doctor Pepe!” Elara’s cry is a razor’s edge. Her arrow slams into
the golem’s chest, followed by a single, piercing
note—<em>“Encore!”</em>—a command to the flesh. The healing light is a
violent shock, forcing his heart to thunder, his lungs to gasp.</p>
<p>Scarlet’s hand shoots forward, cupping a perfect flame. She throws
it. The fire splashes across the golem’s face, a liquid, noiseless
incandescence. The creature recoils as though doused in acid, its
stitched features a mask of primal horror.</p>
<p>Halite, stunned for a half-second, throws a trident. It flies wide.
“Blast!” A second follows, striking the golem’s leg with enough force to
topple it. The behemoth crashes to the floor, prone and flailing.</p>
<p>“Stay down, you stitched-up bastard!” Kragor snarls, marking the
beast with a sickly violet hex. He grips his war hammer, and a beam of
crackling, star-dusted darkness erupts from its head. Where it hits,
flesh bursts and rots.</p>
<p>The party descends on the downed monster. Whisper’s claws find a seam
and rip it open. Doctor Pepe, groaning to his feet, adds two more small
wounds. Burning radiance and fire rain down, arrows pierce, followed by
a final blast of eldritch force. The creature gives one last, shuddering
groan and collapses, its stitches bursting, its composite parts slumping
into a grotesque, inanimate heap.</p>
<p>Silence falls once more. The party breathes heavily, staring at the
carnage. “Well,” Kragor says, studying the remains. “That was…
educational. He’s made of bits of everything.”</p>
<p>Doctor Pepe, his face pale, searches the golem’s room. “Nothing,” he
reports, his voice shaky. “Just rubble.”</p>
<h2 id="a-storm-of-blades">A Storm of Blades</h2>
<p>“Right,” Kragor says, nodding to the door opposite. “You’re up again.
Try not to fall down this time?”</p>
<p>They take their positions. “Let’s try that gambit,” Kragor says to
Elara.</p>
<p>In a sing-song voice, Elara chants, <em>“Imago fallax.”</em> A
shimmering image of the door appears inches in front of the real one.
Kragor’s spectral hand drifts through it, grasps the true handle, and
pulls.</p>
<p>A longsword, humming with malevolent energy, slices silently through
the illusion and bites deep into Whisper’s side. A second, third, and
fourth follow, a whirlwind of steel erupting from the unseen
doorway.</p>
<p>“They can see through it!” Gerhard yells.</p>
<p>A fifth and sixth sword emerge. One finds Whisper’s flesh again, and
she collapses, unconscious. Another flies down the hall in pursuit of
Doctor Pepe and stabs him in the back. He falls, out cold.</p>
<p>“I’m beginning to sense a pattern here,” Kragor groans, clutching a
new wound in his arm.</p>
<p>The sight of her companions falling drives a cold spike through
Scarlet’s heart. She gathers dust and arcane light, spinning them into a
familiar shape. An owl of bone-white and dusk-grey feathers settles on
her shoulder, its eyes twin pools of fey intelligence. Her command is a
thought loosed like an arrow: <em>Go.</em></p>
<p>The owl streaks down the hall and lands on Doctor Pepe’s chest. A
wave of healing energy flows from its talons. The rogue’s eyes snap
open.</p>
<p>Kragor whispers <em>“Mactē virtutē”</em>, and a shimmering carapace
of supernatural ice blooms over his skin. One of the fae-lit blades
swings for his head. It strikes the phantom armor with a sound like a
hammer hitting a frozen coffin. A silent explosion of absolute cold
erupts, and the sword’s animating magic is snuffed out. The enchanted
steel screams as it crystallizes, then shatters into a thousand
glittering splinters.</p>
<p>Halite’s trident catches another sword’s flat. With a jarring
<em>thrum</em>, a violent shiver runs the length of the blade, and its
magic breaks. It clatters to the stone, inert. Elara rushes to Whisper’s
side, a surge of celestial power knitting her wounds.</p>
<p>The tide turns. Gerhard’s scimitar flashes, shearing through a faint
glyph at a blade’s hilt. Doctor Pepe, with a furious, two-handed wrench,
breaks the magic of the sword that felled him. Whisper, a storm of grey
fur, leaps from the wall, her kicks and slaps sending another blade
spinning to the floor.</p>
<p>Only one remains. Before it can choose a victim, Elara’s
silver-tipped arrow leaves the string. It strikes the pommel, and with a
sigh of escaping energy, the sword falls. Its clang echoes in the
sudden, profound silence.</p>
<h2 id="the-echo-of-steel">The Echo of Steel</h2>
<p>Doctor Pepe approaches the doorway, knowing the shimmering image
before him is Elara’s phantom. His mind knows this. His body, however,
remembers the steel.</p>
<p>He peeks his head through, and the world lurches. A memory of pain,
sharp and absolute, seizes him. He doesn’t trip so much as crumple,
pitching forward through the dissolving illusion. His hands, thrown out
to break his fall, land squarely on the pile of razor-edged, broken
swords. The impact tears open ugly wounds. He bites back a scream, his
knuckles white as he grips the hilt of a shattered blade.</p>
<p>Elara winces, letting the last of the illusion fade. It reveals their
companion kneeling in a pile of broken steel, his head bowed in utter,
silent humiliation.</p>
<p>The room beyond is a graveyard of steel. Amidst the ruin, one sliver
of integrity endures. Doctor Pepe’s eye catches a glint. Buried under
rusted spearheads is a longsword, pristine. The blade is the color of a
gathering thunderhead, its flat, non-reflective grey seeming to drink
the light. Within its substance, faint, silvery veins race like a storm
trapped in steel. The hilt is wrapped in pale, petrified
lizard-skin.</p>
<p>Kragor, focusing his arcane senses anew, approaches. “You’ve found a
magic sword,” he announces. Doctor Pepe grins excitedly.</p>
<p>Exhausted and wounded, they retreat to the golem’s room and barricade
the door. Sleep is not a luxury; it is a necessity. They set the
watch.</p>
<p>Kragor takes the first, war hammer across his knees, senses stretched
into the oppressive silence. Halite’s watch is a study in brutal
stillness, the cramped, foul-smelling hole gnawing at him, every scrape
and slither a phantom threat. Doctor Pepe’s watch is a torment. He
huddles near the door, a porcelain doll cracked and crudely glued, the
memory of fists and steel a fresh phantom limb of pain. His confidence
is a ruin. Whisper takes the last, a grey shadow among shadows, coiled,
a spring of deadly potential.</p>
<p>The arcane light flickers, a new day of sorts arrives. They are not
restored, not truly. They are merely… less broken. The gnawing dread
recedes, leaving a hollow ache of exhaustion.</p>
<p>Doctor Pepe rises, his gaze falling upon the longsword. “That is a
thing for a butcher, not a surgeon,” he muses. He looks at his bandaged
hands, remembers the fumbling chaos. That is the longsword’s world, a
brutal ballet for which he has no training. His own dance is quieter,
played with the slim dagger Kragor gave him weeks ago. Acknowledging the
truth of his own nature, he hefts the longsword and offers it,
hilt-first, to the orc.</p>
<p>“This sings a song I do not know how to dance to,” he says.</p>
<p>Kragor’s calloused hand closed around the hilt. The weapon felt
wrong—too light, too clever. He craved the familiar, honest heft of a
war hammer, the straightforward crush of steel on bone. But a cold power
hummed within the blade, a bitter advantage he was forced to claim.</p>
<p>He puts down his war hammer, grips the sword’s lizard-skin hilt, and
shuts his eyes. At his feet, the hammer shimmers and vanishes into
greasy black smoke. Darkness snakes from his palm, sinking into the
blade like ink into water. The sword pulses once with a faint, violet
light, a malevolent heartbeat now in time with his own. The bond is
forged.</p>
<p>He opens his eyes, looks at Doctor Pepe. “I know this tune,” he
rumbles. “It is a dirge.”</p>
<h2 id="briney-behemoths">Briney Behemoths</h2>
<p>Two doors remain. Doctor Pepe, moving like a man made of glass,
approaches the first. The handle turns with unnerving silence. He eases
the door inward. A blast of cold air sighs out, heavy with brine and the
rot of the sea bed.</p>
<p>The chamber beyond is breached. Black water pools across the floor.
Two iron-bound chests loll in the deeps. Then, motion. A carapace the
size of a shield scuttles from the shadows, its claws snapping with a
sharp, wet <em>clack</em>. Another appears, and a third. From a bed of
kelp, a fourth rises, a true behemoth, its stalked eyes fixing on the
doorway.</p>
<p>Doctor Pepe has had his fill of being a toy for monsters. Silently,
he eases the door shut. He turns to the others to share what he’s
seen.</p>
<p>“Leave the crabs be,” Gerhard advises, his gaze already on the final
door. “We don’t have time for seafood.”</p>
<h2 id="ferol-sal-1">Ferol Sal</h2>
<p><img src="ferol_sal.jpg" /></p>
<p>Having charted every other passage, their quest now rested on this
final, unopened door. Doctor Pepe approaches it as a penitent approaches
the block. He is a creature of nerve endings and scar tissue now, his
every movement a careful negotiation with pain. His hands, swathed in
Elara’s bandages, are clumsy ghosts of their former selves as he kneels.
The lock-picking tools are a familiar weight, but the confidence is
gone. He probes the keyhole out of sheer, desperate habit, a prayer
offered to a god he no longer trusts.</p>
<p>Nothing. No click of a pressure plate. No whisper of a scything blade
being set. Nothing.</p>
<p>He presses his ear to the wood. He hears only the frantic drumming of
his own heart and the faint, dry rustle of… something. Paper? Bone? He
cannot tell. He sets his palm against the cold, pitted iron of the
ring-pull, takes a breath, and pulls.</p>
<p>The door swings inward on silent, well-oiled hinges.</p>
<p>A smell washes over him—of dust as old as mountains, of strange,
acrid chemicals that sting the back of the throat, and something else…
the dry, sweet scent of decay. He peers into the gloom.</p>
<p>Beyond is a laboratory. Tables are crowded with alchemical equipment,
bookshelves line the walls, and barrels of strangely bubbling liquids
stand in the corners. In the center of the room, a figure in elaborate
red robes hunches over a desk, working frantically. It is undead, its
skin gray and tight over its skull, its eyes sunken pits, its teeth
long, its fingers tipped with claws. Beyond it, two suits of animated
armor move about the room, fetching and carrying.</p>
<p>The creature looks up, its skull-face a mask of desiccated
irritation. A sound issues from its throat, a dry, whispering rustle
like dead leaves skittering across a tombstone. The sounds mean nothing
to Doctor Pepe, a dead noise in a dead place. His mind stalls, then
lurches. The ring! His bandaged fingers, clumsy with pain, fumble the
silver circlet from his pouch and press it onto his thumb.</p>
<p>The wight makes the sound again, louder this time, impatient. Now,
the alien syllables arrive in Pepe’s mind as a cold, clear thought, a
voice of ancient arrogance superimposed over the rattling hiss. <em>Who
are you to interrupt me? Why do you trespass in my workshop?</em></p>
<p>“We seek a cure for our friends,” Doctor Pepe says, his own voice
sounding thin and shockingly alive in this dead air. He speaks the
Common tongue, a hopeful, desperate gambit.</p>
<p>The creature’s sunken eyes are pits of black incomprehension. It
perceives only vermin within its sterile sanctum. With a deliberate
motion, it raises a long, dusky finger, tipped with a nail resembling a
shard of obsidian, and stabs it in the air. First it points toward the
nearest suit of animated armor, then toward the rogue. The command needs
no translation. With a groan of tortured metal, the armor takes a step
forward.</p>
<p>The animated armor is a ponderous, grinding thing of iron and malice.
But Whisper is a blur of grey fur and coiled fury. Before the construct
can complete its second step, she is past it, a living arrow aimed at
the hunched figure at the desk. Her movement is a fluid, predatory
pounce, a controlled explosion that locks her onto the undead thing.
With the leverage of a striking cat, she ensnares the creature, her grip
like iron bands around its brittle torso. The thing is shockingly light,
a bundle of dry bones and ancient cloth. With a grunt of effort, she
heaves, dragging the hissing wight out of its sanctum and into the chaos
of the hallway.</p>
<p>She does not release her hold. She begins a rattling cascade of
open-hand blows against its ribcage, a staccato of punches that echo
like a mallet against dry wood. Her claws are sheathed; this is a
pummelling, a desperate attempt to break the thing before it can
properly fight back.</p>
<p>“He’s fast!” Gerhard yells, his spectral brand flaring to life on the
wight’s chest. His arrow follows an instant later, a bodkin-tipped
prayer that sinks deep into the creature’s shoulder.</p>
<p>Halite roars, a battle-cry swallowed by the narrow hall, and swings
his trident in a wide, gleaming arc. The wight, impossibly quick, twists
in Whisper’s grasp, and the tines bite only air. Cursing, the goliath
surges, a second swing just as fast as the first, and just as fruitless.
Frustrated, Halite backpedals, trying to find space to fight. As he
moves, the creature’s skeletal hand darts to its belt, drawing a
longsword whose blade glows with a sickly green light. It lashes out, a
parting gift for the retreating goliath, but Halite’s shield catches the
blow with a jarring clang.</p>
<p>The animated armors, their master now embattled, lumber into the
hall. They are single-minded, ignoring the melee to follow their last
order. The first reaches Doctor Pepe, its iron fist slamming into his
side with the force of a battering ram, driving the air from his lungs.
Its second swing goes wide. The second suit of armor is more accurate.
Two crushing, piston-like blows land square on the rogue’s chest, one
after the other. He staggers, his vision swimming in a sea of black
stars.</p>
<p>Through the pain, Doctor Pepe sees his opening. He stumbles forward,
dagger first, but the thrust is clumsy, deflected by the wight’s
flailing robes. His shortsword, however, finds its home, slicing a deep
gash across the undead thing’s desiccated thigh.</p>
<p>From the back of the formation, Elara draws. The arrowhead of her
nocked shaft glows with a soft, silver light. The string sings. The
arrow is a comet of purification, striking the wight just below the
clavicle. There is a sound of cracking ancient bone and a hiss as holy
energy sears unholy flesh. The creature reels.</p>
<p>Kragor extends a hand, and murmers a single, guttural curse. Strands
of a sallow, chartreuse glow cling to the wight like a shroud. Then he
levels the new longsword, channeling his will through the thunder-grey
steel. A beam of star-dusted darkness erupts from its tip, striking the
creature with otherworldly force.</p>
<p>The wight ignores the arrows, the spells, the blade in its leg. It
focuses its ancient hatred on the creature holding it. Its clawed
fingers, hard as obsidian, dig into Whisper’s flesh. It is not a cut,
but a violation. A sucking cold floods the tabaxi’s body, a chilling
void where her life-force used to be. She feels a part of her soul being
siphoned away, devoured by the abyss in the creature’s touch. Before she
can even scream, its glowing green longsword scythes across her middle.
The world dissolves into a final, agonizing slash of pain, and she
collapses, a heap of grey fur on the cold stone.</p>
<p>“Whisper!” Scarlet cries, her face a mask of horror. Her hands move,
weaving light and dust. The spectral owl, Sparky, coalesces on her
shoulder, its feathers the color of dusk and ash, stark against the
gloom.</p>
<p>Whisper’s soul clings to a single, fraying thread. On the black
precipice of death, she holds.</p>
<p>Gerhard’s face is grim. He draws, looses, and his second arrow lands
with even greater force than his first, staggering the wight. Halite,
seeing his opening, hurls his trident like a javelin. It soars past the
wight’s ear and clatters harmlessly down the hall. “Damn my eyes!” he
bellows.</p>
<p>The armors continue their grim work. One slams its fist into Halite’s
shield, a blow so powerful it nearly tears the arm from his socket. The
second suit swings twice at the goliath, its iron fists glancing off his
pauldron and shield with percussive, harmless clangs.</p>
<p>Doctor Pepe, seeing Whisper fall, knows he is next. He fires his
crossbow, the bolt striking the wight’s chest, then dives for the cover
of a nearby doorway, his heart hammering against his bruised ribs.</p>
<p>Seeing the life drain from the tabaxi, a defiance born of desperation
seizes Elara. “Not yet!” she shouts, her voice a clarion call. Another
arrow flies, a shot that finds an impossible, perfect opening, burying
itself deep in the wight’s throat. It stumbles back, clutching the
shaft, its hissing voice growing ragged. Without pausing, Elara sings a
single, sharp word of healing. A golden warmth washes over Whisper,
knitting sinew and sealing wounds. The tabaxi’s eyes snap open. She is
whole again, her wounds sealed, yet a deep, abiding chill remains—a
hollow space where the wight’s touch stole something vital, something
the bard’s healing cannot replace.</p>
<p>The wight itself is grievously wounded, its unholy vitality guttering
like a candle in a gust. It turns its hollow eyes toward Kragor, sensing
the source of the dark power that eats at its being. It takes a single,
shaky step.</p>
<p>This is the moment. Kragor surges forward, crossing the distance in
three pounding strides, a green-skinned avalanche of vengeance. He
brings the new longsword up in a two-handed grip. The thunder-grey blade
drinks the arcane light, its strange, internal veins of silver seeming
to pulse with a cold, hungry light. He remembers his own words. <em>It
is a dirge.</em> He swings.</p>
<p>The blade does not clang or ring. It sings a low, mournful note as it
cuts the air, a chord of finality and ruin. The wight moves to parry,
its own blade a blur of sickly green, but the thunder-grey steel is not
entirely there, its edge slipping through the space between moments. It
meets the wight’s neck. The star-dusted darkness that now infests the
steel devours the creature’s animating magic in a silent, violet flash.
The wight’s head comes free, tumbling to the stone with a dry clatter.
Its body, suddenly just a collection of ancient bones in rotting finery,
collapses in on itself, a puppet with its strings cut. Ferol Sal is
gone, his ancient evil unmade.</p>
<p>Kragor watches the robed skeleton fall, then shifts his gaze, and the
sickly violet aura of his hex leaps from the empty space to cling to the
nearest suit of armor.</p>
<p>The fight is not over. Scarlet’s owl streaks past the remaining
armor, a ghostly distraction that lets the druid land a small glob of
flame spattering against its iron helm. Whisper, woozy and disoriented,
spins to her feet and lashes out at the armor, but her claws find only
air. She snarls, then wisely disengages, melting back down the hall to
safety.</p>
<p>“On the metal ones!” Gerhard shouts, his mark shifting to the second
suit of armor as his bow sings again, his arrow sparking off its chest
plate. Halite, abandoning his thrown weapon to the gloom, rips another
trident from the harness on his back and hews at the same target, a
solid blow that leaves a deep score in the metal.</p>
<p>The first suit of armor swings at Halite. It is a crushing blow that
should have shattered his ribs. But the goliath grits his teeth, his
skin momentarily taking on the hardness of granite. The blow lands with
a dull thud, its force entirely negated. The second armor misses him
twice, its fists hammering the stone wall beside his head.</p>
<p>Doctor Pepe, peeking from his doorway, looses a crossbow bolt that
ricochets harmlessly away. Elara is more fortunate; her arrow bites deep
into a joint in the second armor’s arm.</p>
<p>Kragor steps into the fray, the longsword a blur of grey death. He
brings it down on the first armor. The dirge-song of the blade rings out
as it smashes into the construct’s shoulder. Plates of enchanted iron
buckle and split, and the thing staggers, its animating light flickering
like a faulty lamp, wounded but not yet dead.</p>
<p>Scarlet’s flame goes wide, painting the stone wall with a brief,
angry light. Whisper throws a javelin that glances off its shoulder.
Gerhard’s arrow skips off the armor’s helm with a shriek of metal. But
Halite, finding his rhythm, drives his trident deep into its chest.
There is a grinding crunch, a final shudder, and the construct collapses
into a heap of scrap.</p>
<p>The last armor stands alone, turning its helmeted head from Halite to
Kragor. It lumbers toward the orc, its iron fists raised. Its first blow
is a ponderous, telegraphed swing that Kragor parries with a jarring
clash of steel. As it raises its arms for a second, crushing blow,
Elara’s arrow sinks into the joint of its knee, making it stumble.
Doctor Pepe fires his crossbow. The bolt, a splinter of wood and iron
guided by a hand that has forgotten its own sureness, flies not true but
wide. It sparks against the corridor wall then is swallowed by the
gloom.</p>
<p>It is Kragor who ends it. Another swing of the thunder-grey blade, a
final, sorrowful note hanging in the air. The longsword cleaves the
armor from shoulder to hip. The construct falls apart, two halves of
dead, useless iron that crash to the floor with a deafening, final
clang.</p>
<p>Silence rushes in to fill the void, thick and heavy as grave dust. It
is broken only by the harsh, ragged gulps of air from lungs that have
earned every breath.</p>
<p>Kragor steps over the ruin of the last armor, the dirge-blade in his
hand humming with a low, satisfied thrum. He prods the heap of bone and
rotting silk that was Ferol Sal with the toe of his boot. He kneels. His
scarred green fingers, with a delicacy born of a hundred dissections on
the battlefield, probe the brittle, web-like fabric of the wight’s
robes. He finds them nestled in a secret fold over the skeleton’s ribs:
two small keys of blackened brass, their shapes ornate and unfamiliar.
They are cold as a corpse’s kiss in his palm.</p>
<p>He and Gerhard move deeper into the laboratory, a place of foul
stinks and fouler science. Against the walls, barrels bound in
verdigris-eaten iron stand sentinel. Their contents bubble with a slow,
greasy <em>plop… plop…</em>, releasing a sharp, vinegary reek that
stings the throat and waters the eyes. What dormant plagues or
transformative poisons simmer in that viscous broth, they do not care to
learn.</p>
<p>The workbenches are a tangled nest of glass piping, copper coils, and
simmering retorts. Within the glass, liquids of bilious yellow and
bruised purple drip and steam. This is the wight’s kitchen, the very
crucible where the Frigid Woe was cooked. To jostle a table, to crack a
single vial, would be to invite a death more horrifying than any blade.
They move with the predatory stillness of cats stalking through a room
of sleeping cobras. They manage to liberate a fine set of alchemist’s
tools from one tray, their fingers trembling. A second, simpler set they
find on a high shelf, gathering dust, and claim that as well.</p>
<p>But the search is otherwise a hollow one. There is no great ledger
detailing the wight’s work. No flask labeled with the simple, miraculous
word: <em>Cure</em>. They have decapitated the serpent, but its venom
still courses through the veins of their friends.</p>
<p>Exhausted, they retreat to the golem’s butcher-shop, a council of the
walking wounded. The two brass keys are a heavy weight in Kragor’s
pouch, a question cast in metal. Before them lies a locked room of
scuttling sea-horrors and the cold, sinking heart of the vault. The cure
is still down here, somewhere, waiting in the dark.</p>
