<li><p><strong>Bandits (Pelc’s Curiosities)</strong>: Followers of Hulil

party to Orvo and The Buyer, offers them the yurt of a deceased elf
lordling, and mentions local dangers like sabre-tooth tigers before
heading off on her own expedition.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Old Croaker</strong>: A giant ice frog of unusual size
dwelling in Croaker Cave. Used by Hulil’s bandits (and later the party)
for transport across an underground pool, motivated by treats (bats, elf
hands). It attacked Whisper when startled. Scarlet confirmed it is
venomous.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Orvo Mustave</strong>: A dwarf adventurer in Syrinlya and
friend of the deceased Urgon, identified by a distinctive three-line
scar on his cheek. He accompanied Urgon on the expedition where the blue
vials were found in the Salsvault ruins (located in the Thin Sheets
region). He provides the party with directions, details about the ruin’s
dangers (Ice Mephits, animated armor), confirms he sold his share of
artifacts to The Buyer, and directs them to Javel for snowshoes. He is
saddened and angered by Urgon’s death.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rorik</strong>: A young human crewman from the
<em>Frostfang</em>, rescued alongside Captain Gerhard Eisner and Bret.
He seems loyal to Gerhard.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scarlet</strong>: A halfling druid deeply connected to
nature. She uses her knowledge, healing magic, and combat spells to aid
the party. She identified Verla Pelc’s cause of death, tested the blue
vial for contagion, identified Old Croaker’s venom, and diagnosed
Ingrid’s lycanthropy. She has gained an owl companion (“Sparky”) used
for scouting and has shown skill with the ballista. She acquired
blood-stained snowshoes from Javel.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Stonebeard</strong>: The seasoned captain of the
<em>Remorhaz</em>. Initially deferential to Elro, he reveals a
pragmatic, no-nonsense command style once at sea. He oversees ship
operations, directs the crew during crises (the lycanthropy incident and
the squid attack), interacts with the rescued survivors, and safely
navigates to Syrinlya.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tulgi Lutan</strong>: A solitary trapper in Palebank
Village and sister of Hulil. Afflicted with Frigid Woe, she confessed
her and Hulil’s criminal activities and theft from Urgon, revealing
Hulil’s location in Croaker Cave.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Urgon Wenth</strong>: A dwarven adventurer whose return
from Eiselcross afflicted with Frigid Woe and subsequent death sparked
the story’s central mystery. He recovered Aeorian artifacts, including
the blue vials containing the contagion, from the Salsvault ruins
alongside Orvo Mustave.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Verla Pelc</strong>: The owner of Pelc’s Curiosities in
Palebank Village. Found frozen dead in her shop by the adventurers, a
victim of the Frigid Woe after purchasing the blue vials from Urgon and
handling them.</p></li>

He provides limited magical identification services, confirms Urgon’s
dagger is magical, sells Halite a crystal focus, and identifies a garnet
for Doctor Pepe.</p></li>

agility, stealth, and scouting. She often takes point, gathers
information, and utilizes her claws and thrown weapons in combat. She
