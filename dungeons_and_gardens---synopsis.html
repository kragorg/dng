Synopsis</h1>
<p><span class="dropcap">The adventure began within</span> the
salt-scoured winds of the far north, as a motley band of near-strangers
disembarked from the longship <em>Frostwind</em> onto the docks of
Palebank Village. Each of them braved the perilous voyage across the
Frigid Depths for reasons of their own, lured by tales of lost cities,
potent artifacts, and knowledge beyond mortal ken.</p>
<p>Palebank Village is but a ragged clutch of wooden hovels clinging to
the cliffs like frozen barnacles, but has outsized importance as the
northernmost outpost of Uthodurn, an independent city-state of dwarves
and elves. Upon arrival, the party was greeted not with cheer, but with
a funeral procession. Urgon Wenth, a dwarven adventurer, lay encased in
ice, a victim of a chilling malady contracted during his Eiselcross
delve. A creeping frost stole all his warmth, leaving blue deathly veins
in its wake. Elro Aldataur, the weathered elf leader of the village,
tasked the newcomers with unraveling the mystery, for Urgon’s curse had
brought a halt to all expeditions north.</p>
<p>The party’s investigation began in the shadow of grief. Urgon’s
ransacked cabin yielded a clue: a receipt from Pelc’s Curiosities
detailing the sale of Aeorian relics for a kingly sum of gold. Among the
listed items, ominously, were two blue glass vials. Tracks led to the
adjacent cabin of Tulgi Lutan, another villager succumbing to the icy
affliction. Tulgi, her face a mask of frozen despair, confessed her
allegiance to a Shadycreek Run syndicate, revealing she and her sister
Hulil had plundered Urgon’s findings from Pelc’s Curiosities. She
surrendered a single, exquisitely crafted dagger, claiming Hulil held
the rest in a place of ill repute: Croaker Cave.</p>
<p>Pelc’s Curiosities, its door ominously ajar, became the stage for
their first bloody ballet. Elara, the aasimar bard, and Scarlet, the
halfling druid, startled and blinded bandits inside with a fury of sound
and fog. Kragor, the orc warlock, and Halite, the goliath fighter, made
quick work of the bandits, killing two and capturing the remaining two.
Meanwhile Whisper, the tabaxi monk, scaled rooftops with feline grace
and dealt with a lookout in a tangle of limbs and a sudden, bone-jarring
plummet. The interrogation of the bandits confirmed Hulil’s presence at
Croaker Cave, and revealed she, too, was seeking a cure for the same
frost-sickness. As the party searched the shop for remaining clues, they
found the frozen corpse of Verla Pelc, the shop’s proprietor, a grim
testament to the curse’s reach.</p>
<p>A brief respite at the <em>Jolly Dwarf</em> tavern, punctuated by Arl
Bortock’s wary tales of Croaker Cave— a place shunned for its giant,
man-swallowing ice frogs— did little to soothe their frayed nerves.
Elro, learning of their progress, urged them on. A visit to a wizened
elf named Gramini at the docks yielded healing potions, bartered down in
price with charm &amp; a Scanlan Shorthalt shirt that sent the old elf
into a fit of nostalgic glee.</p>
<p>Croaker Cave, its maw exhaling a chill deeper than the ambient frost,
lived up to its name. Here, they found an unlikely— and perhaps
untrustworthy— ally in the rogue Doctor Pepe, previously encountered on
the roof of Pelc’s Curiosities by Whisper. Doctor Pepe had shadowed them
from there, claiming his own interest in the village’s plague. An
initial scout of the cave by Whisper and Doctor Pepe erupted into
violence as monstrous, mastiff-sized ice frogs attacked. The ensuing
melee saw the adventurers rush to their aid, trident, spell, and claw
felling the amphibious horrors. But from within shadows deep within the
cave, bandits shot crossbow bolts, injuring the heroes. These bandits
soon fell to vengeance in the form of javelin, bullet, and radiant
blast. The surviving assailant, a dwarf, retreated. A frigid pool
separated him from the party, but skillful use of the grappling hook
allowed them to cross and corner the dwarf. He confessed to serving
Hulil Lutan, priestess of Tiamat, now also afflicted with the icy
sickness. He also revealed Hulil’s camp deeper within, and a treacherous
pit trap.</p>
<p>The journey through the cave’s depths led them past a bat-filled
cavern to a vast underground lake, where “Old Croaker,” a frog of truly
titanic proportions, served as both ferry and ferryman. Scarlet’s
preternatural calm, plus an offering of dead bats, persuaded the
behemoth to bear them across. On the far shore, Hulil and an elven
acolyte knelt before a tapestry of Tiamat, the evil five-headed dragon
queen. Battle was joined swiftly. Kragor’s hexes and eldritch blasts,
Scarlet’s druidic fury, Pepe’s unerring crossbow, and Halite’s brutal
javelin throws met Hulil’s desperate dark magic. The priestess, her skin
already marred by the blue streaks of the Woe, fought with the ferocity
of the doomed, her spectral blade and life-draining spells a testament
to her dark faith. But even Tiamat’s favor could not save her. Halite’s
javelin pierced her heart, her dying breath a curse of endless desire
and ruin upon her slayers. Old Croaker, disturbed by the commotion and
Whisper’s ill-timed splash, threatened to devour the tabaxi, only to be
placated by Elara with a severed elf hand— a grisly offering to the
subterranean beast. A chest yielded Urgon’s remaining treasures: a
scroll case, jade statuette, magical arrows, a jasper ring, and a
significant sum of coins, alongside Hulil’s journal. The journal spoke
of selling one blue vial to an “Irven Liel”, in a desperate bid for
funds to find a cure.</p>
<p>Returning to Palebank Village, the adventurers confronted Elro with
their findings, who then went on to send a communiqué to an Uthodurnian
outpost on Eiselcross called Syrinlya. They then discovered at the Jolly
Dwarf that the Irven Liel they sought was a traveling bookseller staying
there with his husband Fenton Tethwick and twin tiefling daughters. A
tense conversation revealed Irven possessed the second blue vial, bought
from Hulil, its surface ominously cracked. Scarlet confirmed it radiated
the feared magical contagion. The Liel-Tethwick family, having handled
the vial, was now at dire risk.</p>
<p>Having conferred with those at Syrinlya, Elro grasped the full horror
of the affliction, and returned to the party to reveal its true name:
the Frigid Woe, an Aeorian weapon designed to destroy the gods. Yet,
hope flickered: Elro discovered through his contacts that a cure
existed, a milky-white liquid stored in golden vials; and they could
likely be found in the same location as the blue vials had been. He then
hired the party to go to Eiselcross to meet Urgon’s partner in the
discovery of the blue vials, offering passage on the ship
<em>Remorhaz</em> and a substantial reward, including an immediate
payout of 200 gold pieces for the recovered blue vials. That night, a
palpable sense of deepening power settled upon each adventurer, their
skills honed, their resolve hardened by the horrors witnessed and the
trials to come. Kragor, however, wrestled with darker portents: upon
waking after unsettling dreams, he found inexplicable earth beneath his
nails, and felt a chilling premonition of his eldritch pact exacting a
steeper price.</p>
<p>The <em>Remorhaz</em>, captained by the initially obsequious, then
brusquely practical Stonebeard, set sail for Syrinlya. The four-day
journey was a microcosm of their larger quest: mundane tasks like
fishing (yielding a barnacle-encrusted anchor from the lost ship
<em>Snowy Plover</em>) interspersed with moments of unexpected
camaraderie and sudden terror. Chef Ingrid, a gruff dwarf with a
moon-and-rune amulet, revealed a talent for divine cookery, and, more
alarmingly, a tendency towards lycanthropy, transforming into a winter
wolf one night. Kragor’s nightmares intensified, culminating in a vision
of being entombed in crushing blue ice, again waking with perplexingly
soiled hands.</p>
<p>The voyage climaxed in a terrifying encounter. Shrouded in dense fog,
the <em>Remorhaz</em> stumbled upon the wreckage of another vessel, its
survivors clinging to flotsam, besieged by a colossal squid. A desperate
battle ensued as the party warred against the beast’s crushing tentacles
and ship-rending beak. They rescued three survivors: Gerhard Eisner,
former captain of the lost <em>Frostfang</em>; his young crewman Rorik;
and Bret, a cagey wizard of the Cerberus Assembly. Stonebeard noted that
the defeated squid had seemed unnaturally focused on the wizard.</p>
<p>Syrinlya greeted them with a howling wind and a landscape of frozen
yurts. Bret and Rorik went their own ways, while Gerhard followed the
adventurers in some shock. Morgo Delwur, a stout dwarf woman, directed
them to Orvo Mustave, Urgon’s former companion. Orvo, scarred and
grieving his friend’s death, revealed the source of the vials:
Salsvault, a ruin two hundred miles northwest, guarded by ice mephits
and animated armor. He warned of the Thin Sheets, treacherous ice, and
the general misery of the journey. The party acquired snowshoes and
supplies from Javel, an ancient, coughing dwarf trader, whose wares
included a pair of ominously blood-stained halfling snowshoes— a yeti’s
leftovers.</p>
<p>As they prepared for the arduous trek, they received word that the
<em>Remorhaz</em> required weeks of repair. Gerhard, broken by his loss
but stirred by Scarlet’s words of resilience, agreed to join their
quest. It was then Kragor, his face a mask of dread, confessed the true
nature of his disturbing nights. His pact, struck in desperation on
Bladegarden’s streets, now seemed to allow his patron influence over his
sleeping form, leading to the terrifying visions and the unexplainable
dirt. Fear of what he might become, or what his body might do without
his consent, hung heavy in the yurt.</p>
<p>The eleven-day journey to Salsvault across the merciless plains of
Foren tested their limits under the baleful light of Ruidus. Kragor’s
nocturnal torments continued, waking with impossible dirt under his
nails after thrashing in his sleep. The trek was fraught with perils: a
near-fatal fall into a snow pit for Halite, a day lost wandering in
circles, and an unsettling encounter with an undead creature searching
for someone named “Lucien.”</p>
<p>Their path was marked by a sudden, brutal encounter with a juvenile
remorhaz, a monstrous worm of ice and fire. A desperate battle ensued,
culminating in Halite delivering a killing blow, though not before he
was wounded by the beast’s searing heat. Scarlet, ever the naturalist,
harvested valuable, fire-resistant scales from its cooling corpse. Their
fortunes later improved with the aid of a grateful griffin, healed by
Scarlet, who provided aerial reconnaissance and a warning of giants in
the far north.</p>
<p>The journey took a bizarre turn when they discovered a massive,
three-foot-tall white dragon egg, which Scarlet identified as being
close to hatching. Kragor, after a painful incident involving his tongue
and the frozen shell, felt a strange kinship with the “orphan” egg. He
declared he would protect it, adding an impossibly heavy and dangerous
burden to their quest, much to the alarm of his companions.</p>
<p>Then, on the eleventh day, they arrived. Their approach to Salsvault
was heralded by an attack from the forewarned ice mephits, which the
party dispatched with brutal efficiency. Beyond the site of the battle,
they saw it: Salsvault, a sloped, ancient structure, its alien
architecture a clear mark of Aeor. But their relief was short-lived. As
they watched, the ground trembled, and the entire ruin began to sink,
slowly but inexorably, into the frozen earth, its entrance threatening
to vanish forever.</p>
<p>Their arrival at Salsvault was a race against the grave, as the ruin
sank inexorably into the ice. Scarlet’s magic melted the frozen door,
only for the party to be met by two soulless suits of animated armor.
After a brutal fight that left Elara battered and Gerhard’s bow snapped,
Kragor’s vengeful magic shattered the constructs. Aided by Doctor Pepe’s
magic ring that could translate the alien script they discovered, they
explored deeper, finding more chests radiating the Frigid Woe. Using
Kragor’s spectral hand, they activated a hidden incinerator, cleansing
the plague from a distance. The cure remained elusive until Scarlet’s
keen eye spotted a secret door. When opened, it revealed not treasure,
but a tide of the vault’s shambling, zombified, and long-dead scholars.
The things were relentless, rising again after being struck down, their
desiccated flesh knitting back with unholy speed.</p>
<p>While this grim battle raged, Halite and Whisper pursued their own
strange errand, drawn to a plume of steam on a nearby mountainside. They
found not a beast, but a marvel of Aeorian engineering: a vast cavern,
warmed by a hot spring, containing a massive, misty-blue sphere. Within
it, trapped inside an electrum dodecahedron, stood a giant of living
flame, frozen in time— save for a single heel, protruding from a warp in
its cage, its licking flames heating a constant stream of snowmelt. A
strange console with a light and a lever offered no answers, only more
questions. Halite, however, discovered a small, corked bottle beneath
it, its contents a swirling, iridescent blue.</p>
<p>They returned to Salsvault to find their comrades still locked in
combat with the unending tide of the dead. With the goliath’s trident
and the tabaxi’s blinding speed, the remaining zombies were overwhelmed
and utterly destroyed by blasts of radiant energy and druidic fire, the
only forces that could grant them final peace. Exhausted, the party
retreated to the strange, warm sanctuary Halite and Whisper had found.
There, under the silent gaze of the caged elemental, lulled by a low hum
vibrating through the seamless marble floor, they took their first true
rest, the mysteries of Salsvault waiting just outside in the unforgiving
cold.</p>
<p>Refreshed by the impossible warmth, they returned to the sinking
tomb. Kragor, his arcane senses awakened, detected not just the familiar
schools of magic, but unfamiliar energies radiating from the Frigid Woe
chests and the caged elemental— wizardry alien to him. Their renewed
exploration began methodically, a door-by-door cleansing of the
zombie-haunted hall.</p>
<p>The first room, a dusty dormitory, yielded only another of the
strange, unrotted robes. Emboldened, they split their forces, a decision
that plunged them instantly into a two-fronted nightmare. As Halite,
Scarlet, and Gerhard investigated a ruined chamber, the very rug beneath
their feet rose up, a smothering beast of dust and thread that swallowed
the goliath whole. Simultaneously, at the far end of the hall, Elara
threw open the door to a kitchen, unleashing a silent, shrieking storm
of animated cutlery.</p>
<p>The corridor became a meat-grinder of uncanny steel and thrashing
fabric. Knives flew, cleavers chopped, and the rug crushed. Whisper
fell, grievously wounded, only to be revived by Elara’s desperate
healing. Scarlet, trapped by the rug, exploded into the form of a
massive draft horse, her bulk tearing her free and her hooves delivering
thunderous, vengeful kicks. Elara, in turn, was struck down, a
life-giving potion from Whisper snatching her back from the brink.</p>
<p>In a flurry of hexed steel, divine light, and brutal force, the party
finally quelled the homicidal housewares and beat the rug into inert
threads. A brief respite saw them discover the kitchen’s sole wonder: a
magical oven that produced loaves of perfectly baked, soul-warmingly
delicious bread.</p>
<p>The next door revealed an immaculate, untouched bedchamber. But its
chest held one last horror: a hissing, roiling ball of desiccated,
undead snakes that erupted to attack. After a short, vicious battle, the
swarm was reduced to ash. Within the chest lay a fortune in Aeorian
coin, but on the room’s desk lay the true prize. A folded letter,
written in faded Draconic, which Doctor Pepe translated. It was the last
testament of the vault’s master, who revealed he had embraced undeath to
continue his life’s work: concocting a plague to kill the very gods who
had allowed Aeor to be destroyed. His final words were not a warning,
but an imploration: find his lab, and finish his work.</p>
<p>The dead man’s imploration hung in the air like frost, a blasphemy so
vast it almost eclipsed the tomb’s immediate squalor. Exhausted,
bloodied, and their nerves frayed, the party retreated once more to the
impossible warmth of the elemental’s cavern, the low hum of the caged
giant a welcome lullaby.</p>
<p>When they returned, three doors remained in the long corridor, which
they cleared with grim purpose. The first of these opened on a dining
hall and six more red-robed zombies, which they dismantled with the
brutal efficiency of those who had grown far too accustomed to the
dead.</p>
<p>The second door revealed a drowned library, the black water a mirror
for the arcane sconces, until it exploded upwards. A slick, purpled
tentacle, thick as a man’s thigh, cracked the air like a wet bullwhip,
then seized Doctor Pepe in a crushing coil, dragging him into the icy
depths. A nightmare of bulging mantle and intelligent, malevolent eyes
surfaced, its horny beak snapping at the air. What followed was a
desperate, chaotic ballet upon the water’s surface, as Gerhard and
Whisper ran across the pool on magically-solid ground. Scarlet plunged
into the glacial dark, her healing magic a desperate pulse of life into
the drowning rogue’s lungs, only to be ensnared herself. It was Halite
who ended it, a titan running on water, leaping to drive his last
trident through the monster’s skull with a roar of pure rage.</p>
<p>As they gasped on the shore, stinking of the abyss, a new horror
found them. A voice in Elara’s mind, faint and familiar: <em>Tulgi has
passed away.</em> The Frigid Woe had claimed another victim in Palebank.
Their time was bleeding away.</p>
<p>The last door held four more zombies, dispatched with weary contempt.
The hall was clear, but the cure remained unfound. The fight leeched
from their bones, they retreated again to the elemental’s warmth, Doctor
Pepe overcome with a profound, unnatural fatigue. That night, as Kragor
wrestled with dreams of blizzards and falling ice, a real storm
descended, burying the world and sealing them in their cave for a long,
howling day.</p>
<p>When it broke, they dug their way out into a world remade in snow,
the trek back to the ruin a two-hour ordeal through drifts as deep as a
man’s chest. They ventured south of the entrance, into a cold forge,
where a pair of twitching boots protruded from a pile of rubble— another
trapped thing, left to its fate. Kragor sensed power beyond the far
door— Transmutation, Evocation, and the alien hum of Aeor. With cunning
use of illusion and spectral hand, they opened it, revealing a new,
unsearched hallway. And from its depths, a sound carried, a heavy and
sporadic thumping.</p>
