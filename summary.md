# Dungeons & Gardens

> A brief recap of the sessions so far. The full story, beginning with the Prequel, can be found on the following pages.

<span class="dropcap">Our story begins in Palebank</span> Village, a ramshackle settlement in the Greying Wildlands of Wildemount, where our party disembarks after weeks at sea aboard the *Frostwind*. Drawn by rumors of Aeorian ruins and artifacts in the frozen expanses of Eiselcross, they’ve arrived at the gateway to this mysterious land, their paths crossing during the voyage.

Upon arrival, the village is in mourning for Urgon, a dwarven adventurer who returned from Eiselcross with treasures but afflicted with a strange freezing illness that eventually claimed his life. Elro, an elven Glassblade (village protector), informs the party that expeditions to Eiselcross have been suspended due to this mysterious illness. He seeks their help in investigating the cause, particularly since another villager named Tulgi shows similar symptoms.

At the Jolly Dwarf tavern, the party meets Arl Bortock, the jovial dwarven innkeeper, who provides them with lodging and information. They learn that Urgon had recently explored Aeor, and Tulgi is a solitary local trapper.

Investigating Urgon’s cabin, they find it ransacked. Among the scattered possessions, they discover a receipt from Pelc’s Curiosities detailing the sale of Aeorian items: a dagger, scroll case, jade statue, quiver of arrows, jasper-set silver ring, and two blue glass vials. Following tracks to Tulgi’s cabin, they find her suffering from the same blue-streaked affliction as Urgon. She confesses that she and her sister Hulil are criminals from Shady Creek Run sent to steal Aeorian treasures. Tulgi reveals that Hulil possesses the remaining artifacts in Croaker Cave.

At Pelc’s Curiosities, the party encounters bandits ransacking the shop. A fierce battle ensues, during which a mysterious rogue (later known as Doctor Pepe) observes from the rooftop. The party defeats the bandits and discovers the frozen body of Verla Pelc, the shop owner, another victim of the freezing sickness.

The surviving bandits reveal they were sent by Hulil, a priestess of Tiamat who has contracted the freezing sickness and is searching for a cure. They confirm that Hulil possesses the Aeorian artifacts and is hiding in Croaker Cave.

Seeking information about the mysterious blue powder associated with the disease, the party visits Gramini, an elderly elf who sells healing potions. They purchase potions at a negotiated price, partly trading a Scanlan Shorthalt shirt they found in Urgon’s cabin.

The party then journeys to Croaker Cave, where they encounter Doctor Pepe, who formally introduces himself and offers to help. Inside the cave, they battle giant ice frogs (including one that practically swallows Whisper) and bandits loyal to Hulil. They learn that the massive frog known as “Old Croaker” serves as transportation across an underground pool.

Deep in the cave, they confront Hulil, a dwarf priestess of Tiamat afflicted with the freezing sickness. After defeating her and her remaining follower, they discover a chest containing the stolen Aeorian artifacts, though the two blue vials mentioned in Urgon’s receipt are missing. From Hulil’s journal, they learn she sold one vial to someone named Irven Liel.

Returning to Palebank Village, they meet Elro, who informs them the disease is called “Frigid Woe,” a weapon created by ancient Aeorians that can be cured with a milky white liquid stored in golden vials. Elro offers them payment to recover the artifacts and hires them to travel to Eiselcross to find the cure.

The party tracks down Irven Liel, a traveling bookseller staying at the Jolly Dwarf with his husband Fenton and their twin tiefling daughters. Irven reveals he purchased a cracked blue vial from Hulil as an investment. The party confirms it contains the same magical contagion and warns the family they may be infected.

Preparing for their journey to Eiselcross, the party acquires supplies and visits Westeroff, a retired wizard who helps identify some of their magical items. They board the Remorhaz, a ship captained by Stonebeard, who instructs them to find Orvo Mustave upon reaching Syrinlya in Eiselcross.

The party embarks on their journey to Eiselcross aboard the Remorhaz. Once beyond Palebank’s harbor, Captain Stonebeard drops his deferential façade and runs a more practical ship, insisting everyone contribute. The adventurers take on various tasks — Whisper helps with rigging, Scarlet and Halite assist in the kitchen, while others fish.

During their fishing efforts, Kragor pulls up an ancient anchor from “The Snowy Plover,” a legendary privateer ship. This discovery delights the crew, who see it as a good omen. Doctor Pepe proves particularly adept at fishing, bringing in an impressive haul.

Below deck, Chef Ingrid, a dwarf wearing a distinctive moon-and-rune amulet, teaches several party members to cook. Under her guidance, they prepare a feast that amazes everyone aboard. Ingrid recognizes the special talents of Kragor, Halite, and Doctor Pepe, gifting them cooking utensils in recognition of their aptitude.

Evening entertainment includes a card game called “The Crick Queen’s Call,” with Elara and Doctor Pepe displaying particular skill. Later, Elara delivers a captivating musical performance that enchants the entire crew, creating a night of celebration and camaraderie.

During the night, chaos erupts when a winter wolf is discovered in the kitchen, confronted by First Mate Ironfist and crewman Haldor. The party notices Ingrid’s amulet discarded nearby. After Whisper is injured trying to retrieve the amulet, Halite entangles the wolf in a net, and Elara manages to place the amulet around its neck.

The wolf transforms back into Chef Ingrid, revealing her lycanthropy. Captain Stonebeard, apparently unaware of her condition, orders everyone back to bed while privately confronting Ingrid about her secret.

Throughout their journey, each party member experiences personal growth. Elara masters new melodies and enchantments; Whisper develops greater agility and resilience; Scarlet deepens her connection with nature and gains an owl companion; Halite hones his tactical abilities; Kragor discovers new arcane powers; and Doctor Pepe refines his already formidable stealth and dexterity.

As the session ends, the party continues their voyage to Eiselcross, now with stronger bonds and abilities, preparing to face whatever challenges await them in their quest to find the cure for Frigid Woe.
