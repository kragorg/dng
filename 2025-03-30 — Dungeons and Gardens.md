# Frigid Woe

As the sun sets over Palebank Village, casting a warm glow, the adventurers return to Gramini’s shop. Seeking answers about the mysterious blue powder, they notice a familiar sight— their own traded t-shirt featuring Scanlan Shorthalt, now framed above a lipstick-stained autographed card, and priced at 500 gold pieces.

Halite places some of the Aeorian artifacts on Gramini’s counter, hoping for insight. “Alas,” she says, “this is beyond my expertise. I’m just a poor shopkeep. But Westeroff, a retired wizard up by the cliffs, can perhaps help for a few coins.” She points up the hill to a house with red shutters. “Not many of those arcane and meddlesome minds here in Palebank,” she notes.

Before leaving, Whisper inquires on Elro’s whereabouts. “He’ll be near city hall,” Gramini replies, “where you’ll find the prison and tax center.”

As city hall is on the way back to the Jolly Dwarf, the party decides to stop there first. Sure enough, we encounter Elro. “Hail, my friends. What news do you bring?” he asks.

Elara explains all that has happened in the cavern: the bandits, the frogs— especially Old Croaker, and Hulil’s role as the leader.
“That explains the deranged dwarf our Glass Blades running by town with his hands bound. He’s now in jail. I thank you for ridding our village of the scum. There was a bounty on that gang: 75 gold pieces. You’ve earned it.”

Kragor blurts out, “Have you heard the name Irven Liel?”

“No,” respods Elro. “Should I have?”

“I don’t know. But we found a journal of Hulil’s, and it recorded that she sold an Aeorian artifact— a blue vial— to one Irven Liel. We believe this vial is connected to the sickness.” Kragor goes on to explain Hulil’s condition, the blue powder seen in the chest, and the vials.

“That does seem consequential. I will post a message to Syrinlya about this. It’s an outpost of Uthodurn on Eiselcross— perhaps they can make something of your tale.” says Elro. “Meanwhile, I suggest you ask about town for this Liel fellow.”

## The Liel-Tethwicks

The adventurers make their way back to the Jolly Dwarf, the warmth of the bustling tavern offering a welcome respite from the biting cold outside. Inside, a comforting glow emanates from the hearth, painting cheerful flickering patterns on the wooden walls. Arl Bortock, the jovial dwarf bartender, gives them a nod of acknowledgment as he polishes a mug behind the counter.

Elara approaches the bar with a knowing smile. “We’d love to get some dinner, Arl,” she requests smoothly, sliding six silver pieces across the counter.

“Coming right up,” Arl replies, flashing a grin as he pockets the coins.

As they settle at a table, Elara’s gaze lingers on a nearby family she recognizes from earlier. They seem a motley bunch: two adult men and twin tiefling girls. Curiosity piqued, she leans closer and asks Arl, “Who’s the family over there?”

Arl chuckles, his beard catching the firelight. “Oh, them? That’s the Liel-Tethwicks. Irven there is a bookseller, traveling far and wide. On their way to Uthodurn, they are.”

Halite perks up at the mention of books. “A bookseller? Fancy myself a reader,” he comments, a hint of enthusiasm in his voice.

Irven Liel, overhearing, turns to them with a friendly wave. “Indeed, we are booksellers,” he confirms. “Irven Liel, at your service. We take orders and ship to stores from here to Uthodurn— I’m a wholesaler. Even Gramini is planning to stock some of our best sellers.”

Recognizing the name from Hulil’s journal, Whisper, ever the blunt one, asks outright, "How about vials?”

Irven’s expression briefly turns guarded. “Uh, who have you been talking to? I don’t know about any vials.”

“What kind of books do you sell?” Elara asks, trying to avoid spooking the merchant before having the chance to get his whole story.

Irven chuckles, his caution momentarily set aside. “Oh, ‘Feather Leather’ is flying off the shelf these days.”

Halite gives a good-natured sigh, a touch disappointed that Irven isn’t in retail business directly. “Shame you’re not a typical bookseller; could have browsed all afternoon.”

Elara leans in, her voice lowered and serious. “We’re on a quest to solve the popsicle sickness affecting the village. We came across some blue vials, and your name is connected to them.”

Irven swallows visibly, his glance darting to one of his daughters before he replies, “The vial… I hope it has nothing to do with the sickness.” His voice gains a note of concern.

Halite, sensing a deeper conversation is needed, suggests, “Perhaps we should speak privately.” Irven nods, then turns to his husband. “Fenton, could you keep an eye on the girls?” To the tieflings, he says, “Daddy’s just selling some books.”

Fenton Tethwick nods in understanding and begins talking animatedly with the twins, keeping them distracted.

In a quieter corner of the tavern, Irven reveals a small blue vial from his coat, a hairline crack marring its otherwise perfect surface. “I bought this from a woman named Hulil who needed quick money. Met her on the road,” he explains, a touch of defensiveness creeping into his tone. “Is this related to the disease?”

Halite studies the vial thoughtfully. “What did she say it was?”

Irven hesitates, then admits, “She claimed it was a magical artifact from Aeor, something that would fetch a high price. I paid 40 gold with the intent of selling it for much more.”

Whisper, sensing the urgency of the situation, interjects gently, “Perhaps you’d allow Scarlet to check for the disease?”

Irven nods hesitantly, his anxiety clear. “My whole family has touched this…” he confesses, fear evident in his eyes.

Scarlet focuses, murmuring an incantation under her breath. A soft glow emanates from her hands as she confirms, “It’s the same magical contagion, just like in the chest we found.”

Irven’s shoulders slump, his fear for his family’s safety evident in his eyes.

Taking the fragile vial into his pouch with extreme care, Doctor Pepe remarks, “Best not to touch this further.”

Scarlet gives Irven a serious look. “I think you should spend some quality time with your children,” she advises. Irven blanches.

Halite adds, “Anyone in the family showing any symptoms? Blue streaks of the skin? Inner chill? Slowed movements?”

Irven shakes his head, his relief tempered by worry.

Elara gives him a hopeful smile. “Don’t lose hope. You’ve met the right people. We’ll find a cure and return.”

Irven does his best to smile, gratitude momentarily overshadowing his anxiety. “Thank you. If nothing else, perhaps I can get you a signed copy of ‘Feather Leather’ when this is over.”

Their conversation concluded, the party returns to their table, now laden with an evening meal of salt fish, squid, and bread. While they eat, they study once again the artifacts they’ve traced back to Urgon. Kragor concludes that the dagger is likely magical, as it has nary a scratch upon it. Halite realizes that the scroll case is inlaid with a map of the multiverse from before the Calamity, making it two or three thousand years old. Doctor Pepe judges the silver ring set with a jasper stone could fetch as much as 50 gold pieces, given the right buyer. Nothing more can be ascertained of the jade statuette of a storm giant, nor the quiver of magic arrows.

Meanwhile, Whisper suggests, “Maybe we should talk Arl into a deep clean of the area, just in case.”

Halite calls Arl over, his voice bearing the gravity of their findings. “Arl, we suspect that some of the items linked to this accursed disease might have been handled here. A thorough cleaning is advisable to ensure safety.”

The dwarf’s eyes widen, the jovial air around him dissipating like mist in the morning sun. His hands flutter nervously. “You’re saying… here? In my inn? By the gods, what if it’s already spread?”

Sensing his rising panic, Elara steps in smoothly, her voice a balm of reassurance. “Arl, take a deep breath. We’ve caught this early enough, and with some care, we can prevent any further trouble. Trust us, we’re on top of this.”

Arl nods, though his brow remains furrowed with concern. “Right, right. I’m on it. I’ll have the place spick and span before the next round of guests even consider laying a foot in here!” His voice quivers with determination as he hurries off toward the back, intent on gathering supplies and rallying his staff for an impromptu deep clean.

Before he retreats entirely, he turns back toward the adventurers, his eyes pleading yet grateful. “Make sure Elro knows what you’ve uncovered. If anyone can coordinate the village through this, it’s him. And thank you… truly.” He disappears into the back of the inn, leaving the party in the flickering warmth of the common room.

## The cause and the cure

The lingering warmth of the Jolly Dwarf fades as the adventurers step into the chill evening air, the glow of lamps casting long shadows across the path. They gird themselves for another trek in the icy wilderness, the promise of knowledge drawing them toward the cliffside dwelling of the wizard Westeroff.

Just as they’re about to depart, Elro approaches with hurried steps, his breath visible in the cold as he greets them. “Ah, just in time,” he says, voice laced with urgency. “I’ve received word from my contacts. They’ve confirmed some crucial details about this disease— called the Frigid Woe.”

The party gathers closer, attentive. “Frigid Woe?” Elara echoes, eyes wide.

“Yes,” Elro affirms, nodding gravely. “It is a weapon that originates from Aeor, and it is familiar to the folks of Eiselcross. But there is hope— a cure exists, stored in golden vials by the Aeorians— a milky white liquid. Wherever Urgon found those vials, that might be your best hope of finding a cure.”

Kragor scratches his chin thoughtfully. “And you believe the Aeorians created this… to fight the gods?”

Elro nods. “Precisely. They despised the gods, and Frigid Woe might have been some experimental weapon against them.” He reaches into his satchel, producing a small pouch and extending it to them. “This is 100 gold pieces. Your reward for solving the mystery of this sickness.”

Before anyone can respond, he inquires, “Have you accounted for all of the powder?”

Doctor Pepe steps forward, quick to respond. “We’ve managed to gather all we could, from both of the vials that Urgon found.”

Elro continues, “I’m also hiring you to travel to Eiselcross and retrieve this cure. There’s a ship, the Remorhaz, that will take you there.”

Elara, ever the bargain hunter, stirs the conversation. “Considering the journey’s danger, perhaps we require a bit more compensation for our troubles…”

Elro gives her an appraising look, recognizing the negotiation for what it is. “I’ll tell you what— securing these vials is vital. We can’t risk any more exposure. I’ll give you 200 gold for both of them.”

Satisfied with the transaction, Elara turns to less mercantile matters. “What about Irven’s family, Elro? They’ve handled the powder.”

Understanding the weight of her concern, Elro promises, “I’ll see to it that they’re looked after.” The sincerity in his eyes reflect his commitment to his people. “But their best chance is for you to find the cure. Join the Remorhaz at the docks tomorrow morning, and godspeed in your search.”

## Novices become adepts

As night casts its velvet cloak over Palebank Village, the adventurers decide to postpone their visit to the wizard until the next day. They return to the warmth of the Jolly Dwarf, each contemplating the challenges to come, and each preparing to rise to meet them in their own way.

### Elara’s melodies

Seated cross-legged, Elara cradles her harp in open hands, letting its whispers envelop her in dreams of enchantment. Her fingers skim across the strings in a luminescent dance of sound, drawing new spells from the air. Gossamer threads of magical light weave about her, their glow etching new incantations into her very soul. With a gentle exhalation, she unlocks a song of healing, each phrase as comforting as the night breeze.

She continues her playing as a serene focus descends upon her. The harp’s strings seem to sing secrets of the heart, imbuing her with a profound understanding— her expertise unfolds, perfectly tuned to the art of performance and the delicate dance of persuasion.

The music further whispers of tales yet untold, a promise of connection and influence. Even without formal training in other disciplines, Elara gains insight into untapped abilities— half-realized potentials suddenly within reach. It lends her a subtle strength, as if no skill was beyond her.

With a determined smile, she finishes her tune, the final chord lingering in the air like a promise. Rising to her feet, Elira knows she is ready to enchant the world beyond the tavern doors— her melody an invitation to the stories awaiting her.

### Whisper’s silent growth

In a dimly lit corner of the bustling tavern, Whisper sits cross-legged, her eyes closed amidst the clamor of laughter and clinking tankards. The scent of ale and roasting meat wafts through the air, but she remains undistracted, ensconced in serene focus. As she meditates, a soft glow seems to emanate from her, unnoticed amidst the tavern’s revelry. She envisions her paws moving with blinding speed as she delivers a flurry of blows. In her mind’s eye, she dodges imaginary foes, or dashes quickly beyond their reach, her agility making her untouchable.

As her meditation centers ever deeper, her mind unlocks the secrets to an uncanny metabolism, a wellspring from which she can conjure a healing warmth in times of need. The noise around her fades as her energy replenishes, strength flowing through her limbs. With a deep breath, Whisper opens her eyes, calm amidst the bustle of the tavern. She rises gracefully, her spirit and body recharged, ready to journey forth.

### Scarlet’s communion with nature

Scarlet finds solace near an open window, the night air bracing and alive with the scent of distant pine. Her connection to nature swells, a tide of life embracing her. She opens herself to the rhythm of the earth, her pulse aligning with the heartbeat beneath the soil. There, against the backdrop of swirling snow, an owl materializes seemingly from the very night itself. Its eyes are like twin moons, wise and knowing, reflecting the mysteries of the wild. The owl glides soundlessly through the air, its wings barely a whisper, and alights gracefully upon Scarlet’s shoulder.

Its presence carries an aura of calm authority, and Scarlet feels an inherent connection, as if this creature embodies the teachings of the natural world itself. The owl tilts its head, eyes locking with hers, and in that silent exchange, Scarlet senses a flow of knowledge and guidance. It’s as if the owl is instructing her, its ancient wisdom translating into her newfound ability to embrace the forms of the earth’s creatures.

As Scarlet absorbs this unspoken language, understanding blooms within her, bright as a flower in spring. She realizes the shapes are not just forms to take, but expressions of nature’s heart, each with its own spirit and strength. She envisions herself melding into these familiar forms from her wanderings: a lithe wolf nimbly leaping through snow, a spider weaving its intricate web, a silent rat darting beneath floorboards, a wild boar charging towards an unwelcome intruder.

With her new companion perched beside her, she feels ready to explore these mysteries, emboldened by the owl’s watchful presence.

### Halite’s martial resolve

In the dim glow of the tavern, the hulking goliath fighter Halite sits by the hearth. His mind drifts as snowflakes gently strike frosted windowpanes, whispering secrets of distant mountains. Sharp-witted with a tactical mind honed through countless battles, he absorbs the warmth and comfort of the crackling fire.

After the hearty meal, he feels a shift within, an unlocking of potential— his warrior spirit thrumming louder than the chilling winds outside. Physical power tingles through his veins, and he feels that he can push himself to transcend his previous limits. For a brief moment, he envisions the battlefield, where when it counts most, he might harness his mastery of combat to deliver two strikes in the span of a heartbeat.

Concurrently, his tactical mind sharpens. In moments of uncertainty, when failure teeters on the edge, he foresees a path to grasp success through sheer force of will, channeling his well of physical and mental stamina not for healing, but for piercing clarity.

With newfound conviction, Halite rises, his eyes gleaming with the knowledge of battles yet to come. He silently thanks the icy land, for in its heart, he unearths his destiny, expertly attuned to strategy and power.

### Kragor’s arcane resonance

The wind howls outside, rattling the shutters of the room Kragor shares with his companions. For now, he sits alone on the edge of the bed, tracing patterns in the frost-laden air with curious fingers. He recounts the night before— a restless night as if he had nightmares he could not recall. Upon waking he’d found his fingernails cracked and caked with mud, despite recalling his fastidious evening routine. Lost in these thoughts and unnoticed by him, the air vibrates with an arcane potential.

As he absent-mindedly mutters an incantation, the cosmic swirl of his thoughts unlocks a hidden door. An esoteric rite unfolds, and to his astonishment, a warm surge of magic fills him, restoring some of the energy he expended earlier— a tether to a newfound reservoir of power.

The frozen wilderness outside remains indifferent, but within, the orc feels another sudden, unfamiliar pulse of eldritch energy. Tentatively, he pulls at invisible strands of weave, knitting a protective cocoon around his form. Kragor’s eyes flicker with newfound vitality as the magic fortifies his life essence— an unexpected shield that bolsters his spirit against the encroaching cold.

Riding this increasing surge of potential, he focuses on his ability to blast foes with beams of crackling energy, and he senses it pulsate with amplified ferocity. He knows, intuitively, that this agonizing blast will now carry his own formidable willpower in every cast, more impactful than ever before.

Astonished and invigorated, Kragor contemplates this new reality. Alone but empowered, he clutches onto these gifts as if they are all that keeps him from freezing over.

### Doctor Pepe’s subtle mastery

While shadows dance against the walls, Doctor Pepe reclines near the glow of the hearth, his mind a labyrinth of possibilities and calculations. As a rogue, his path is a tapestry of subtlety and effectiveness, and tonight, he seeks to enhance these skills further.

As Doctor Pepe savors a sip of spiced cider, an inner shift occurs. Suddenly, each clink of tankard and creak of floorboard sharpens his senses. It’s as if time itself bends to his will. He realizes he has gained a new understanding, an innate quickness; an ability to exploit the lulls between heartbeats.

With a grin, he tests this newfound agility. A scattered glance is enough, and he can already plot a stealthy advance between crowded tables or an agile escape out the back into the blizzard’s embrace. In this quiet moment by the hearth, while the world outside lies in icy slumber, the rogue embraces this eerie cadence of clarity, ready to weave through shadows as swiftly as the swirling snow. Outside, the frozen landscape looms, but within, Doctor Pepe feels the spark of agility warming their soul.

## Mathias’s Stuffs

Morning light filters softly through the frost-touched windows of the Jolly Dwarf, casting dancing patterns over the adventurers as they awaken, well-rested and invigorated. The warmth of the inn lingers like an inviting blanket, fortifying them against the chill that awaits outside.

After a hearty breakfast and a few shared laughs, their eyes are set on the tasks ahead. A meeting with Westeroff, the wizard mentioned by Gramini, promises answers to the riddles entwined with their quest— particularly regarding the mysterious Aeorian artifacts they carry. But first, they decide to procure equipment and provisions for their expedition to Eiselcross.

Their path leads to Mathias’s Stuffs, an establishment with all the disarrayed charm of a barn filled with a collector’s treasures. The smell of aged wood and dust greets them, mingling with the morning chill as they step inside. A harried elf stationed behind a counter scribbles inventory notes, his goatee betraying an indifference to grooming. At the sound of the door opening, he looks up with a sharp gaze that softens slightly upon Elara’s introduction.

“Hello, we’re new in town and in search of supplies. What do you have in stock?” she asks, her voice bright with purpose.

The elf glances up from his ledger, his expression shrewd. “Mathias,” he grunts by way of introduction, setting down his quill. His gaze lingers not unkindly on Elara.

Kragor leans in, curiosity piqued. “Any armor, perhaps studded leather?”

Mathias shakes his head. “None of that, I’m afraid.”

Elara interjects with a playful smile. “How about armor suitable for my frame, good sir?”

Mathias, eyes catching her current armored attire, notes its superior quality compared to his stock. “Sadly, only a well-used leather set, and that’s a fine piece you’re already wearing,” he compliments, acknowledging her chosen gear.

Whisper, scanning the collection of objects, approaches Mathias. “I’m in need of a quarterstaff,” she requests. Mathias nods thoughtfully, casting his eyes over his assortment. “Hmm, let me see...”

He roots through the inventory with nimble fingers, selecting a spear. With a swift motion that betrays the construction of the weapon, he detaches the spearhead and, with a flourish, presents the result to Whisper.

“Will this do?” he asks, offering her the altered weapon. Whisper appraises it with a satisfied nod and exchanges two silver pieces for the makeshift quarterstaff.

Meanwhile, Doctor Pepe, always one to seek the unique, spots an eccentric and charming two-billed olive drab hat perched atop a mound of miscellany. “And this?” he asks, gesturing.

“One silver piece,” Mathias pronounces, and with a grin, the hat changes hands.

Halite, practical as ever, requests javelins. Mathias uncovers three, displaying them with a flourish. “Fifteen silver pieces for the lot,” he proposes.

Buying turns to selling, as the party offers three scimitars at twelve gold each and six crossbows for thirty gold apiece in trade. They also arrange to secure one month’s provisions for fifteen gold, one hundred bolts for five gold for Doctor Pepe, and an equally priced set of one hundred arrows for Elara.

With the practicalities of commerce concluded, the conversation shifts, prompted by Kragor’s curiosity regarding their forthcoming journey.

Kragor, leaning casually against the counter, inquires, “Mathias, what can you tell us about Eiselcross? We’re heading there soon.”

Mathias pauses, scratching his chin thoughtfully. “Ah, Eiselcross,” he begins, his voice taking on a conspiratorial tone. “I hear the wild folk there are mostly harmless, tendin’ to their own and preferrin’ solitude. They value their privacy, so it’s best to steer clear of their paths.”

He hesitates as if weighing his words before continuing, “But there’s a group among ’em, see? Ones with black streaks across their faces. Violent bunch, they are. Best to avoid ’em entirely— ain’t no good will come from crossin’ their path.”

Elara nods, absorbing the information. “And what about this Westeroff fellow in Cliffside?” she inquires. “We’ve heard he might have insights about some… peculiar objects.”

Mathias shrugs, an enigmatic smile curling at the corners of his lips. “Westeroff’s a nice old guy,” he says, leaving the description teasingly vague. “Keeps to himself mostly. If anyone knows about oddities, it’d be him. But that’s about as much as I can say.”

Their business concluded, the adventurers depart the shop, heading across town to where the wizard’s abode waits.

## Westeroff

The adventurers approach Westeroff’s doorstep, noting the intricately carved runes above the threshold that spell out his name in a flourish of archaic script. The chill of the air is palpable, the morning fog still clinging to their cloaks as Halite steps forward and firmly knocks on the wooden door.

Elara, in a burst of mischievous artistry, begins to strum her harp, the notes echoing with an unrestrained exuberance. Just then, the door creaks open, revealing a diminutive gnome, stooped with age, his glasses perched precariously on his nose. His eyes narrow disapprovingly at Elara.

“Ah, what racket is this? A house of study, not a tavern!” Westeroff grumbles, waving a hand as if to clear the air of the lingering melodies. Elara stifles a giggle, ceases her harp playing, and offers a graceful curtsy. “Apologies, Master Westeroff,” she says.

Halite steps closer, bending to meet the gnome’s gaze. “We seek your expertise,” he begins, presenting a beautiful scroll case. “Can you tell us about this?”

Westeroff’s eyes widen, the ancient glow of curiosity kindling within them. “Ah, from the Age of Arcanum...” he mutters, running a delicate finger over its surface. “A marvelous relic! Where did you find such a treasure?”

“It came to us through a series of hands,” Halite explains. “Originally discovered by Urgon on a journey to Aeor, and eventually finding its way to us.”

Westeroff strokes his chin thoughtfully, casting a quick, assessing glance at the scroll case. “I could...foreseeably offer you fifteen gold for it,” he suggests with a sly smile, attempting to conceal his eagerness.

Halite, resolute, shakes his head. “We’ll keep it, I think,” he responds diplomatically, tucking the case back into his pack.

Unperturbed, Westeroff adjusts his spectacles and peers at Kragor, who just then presents a gleaming dagger. “And what can you tell me about this, sir?”

“It’ll cost you five gold for me to reveal its secrets,” Westeroff states, arching a brow.

Kragor agrees, passing the coins. The gnome produces a pearl and a feather, casting a spell. “Ah, this dagger has some magic… it will help the wielder stab on mark and hard,” he announces, nodding appreciatively.

The group brings out some of the other items, such as the ring and the statue, but Westeroff discounts them as mundane. Their questions soon shift to graver matters. “What do you know of the Frigid Woe and these vials?” Scarlet inquires, her expression serious.

Westeroff strokes his chin. “This is familiar to me, knowledge shared from a fellow wizard. An Aeorian experiment, no doubt, aimed against divine armies. As for cures, golden vials with milky liquid, I’ve heard whispers, but nothing concrete.”

Their curiosity satiated for now, Whisper inquires about potions. Westeroff leads them to a dust-laden shelf, presenting a disgusting-looking potion. “This potion will give you the strength of a hill giant! Five hundred gold, if you’ve got it,” he offers with a sly grin, fully knowing its worth exceeds their purses. Whisper confirms it, saying, “I’m afraid that’s more coin than we can spare.”

The adventurers take a final look around at Westeroff’s laboratory. Meanwhile, Doctor Pepe, ever the rogue, slips aside with Westeroff to identify the properties of a garnet he has concealed, the exchange of five gold pieces masked beneath the party’s ongoing conversation.

Halite eyes a crystal appropriate for arcane focus. He is taken by it, although he is no spellcaster himself, and agrees to pay ten gold from his own stash.

As they prepare to leave, Kragor reveals their mission’s urgency, prompting Westeroff to offer healing potions at a fair 50 gold each. After a short debate, they decide to hold on to their cash reserves.

Elara steps forward, offering a sincere nod. “Thank you for sharing your knowledge and time, Master Westeroff. We’ve much to ponder.” Her words, free from their earlier playfulness, carry genuine gratitude as she tucks her harp beneath her arm.

Westeroff grunts, a subtle acknowledgment mingled with a touch of gruff affection. “Just keep your adventures quiet— some of us need peace to think!” His eyes twinkle, a rare smile brushing the corners of his lips.

## The Remorhaz

The docks of Palebank Village are beginning to bustle as the adventurers approach the sleek silhouette of the Remorhaz, its sails furled and ready. The icy wind nips at their cheeks, adding a rosy hue to faces already aglow with anticipation. Elro greets the party, his presence a reassuring anchor amidst the chaos of departure preparations.

“Remember,” Elro instructs, “find Orvo Mustave in Syrinlya. He knows the lay of the land. Send back the cure once you’ve secured it— the Buyer can teleport it directly to us.”

Kragor nods, his grave expression matching the gravity of their mission. “Snowshoes— are they useful for the ice?” he inquires. Elro chuckles dryly. “In Eiselcross, where lava sometimes flows under a thin veneer of ice, yes, they’ll come in handy.”

“How big is this Syrinlya? And how long will our trip be?” Scarlet asks. “Oh, I’d say there’s about 250 souls there. And the trip is not too long. I expect you’ll arrive about four days hence.”

Whisper surveys the Remorhaz as the party is brought on board. It is a small ship with three sails, armed with two ballistas, one fore and one aft. “A fast ship meant as a scout and message courier,” she thinks to herself.

Aboard, Captain Stonebeard presents a polished performance. His eyes twinkle with exaggerated warmth as Elro steps aboard, each syllable dripping with supplication. “Ah, welcome to the Remorhaz, Master Elro,” he croons, offering a low bow as if addressing nobility. The captain’s voice is rich as cream, his deferential tone almost theatrical.

Elro acknowledges him with a nod, the hint of a smile touching his lips. “I trust you’ll see them safely to Syrinlya, Captain. Their mission is of utmost importance.” Stonebeard gestures expansively around the ship, his posture rigidly respectful. “But of course, Master Elro. We are honored to have them.”

Even as they talk of weather patterns and navigation routes, Stonebeard’s demeanour remains flawless. His subordinates echo his pleasantries with subtle nods and murmurs of agreement. The atmosphere is one of airbrushed civility— concealing the practical grittiness essential to life at sea.

However, the moment the Remorhaz pushes past the harbor’s mouth and Palebank diminishes into a mere silhouette against the frosty horizon, a discernible shift occurs, like the release of a drawn bowstring.

Captain Stonebeard’s genial facade melts away, replaced by the steely visage of a seasoned mariner. “Alright, enough pandering,” he declares brusquely, rolling his shoulders as if shedding a constrictive garment. “This ship won’t sail itself, and there’s work to be done.”

The party exchanges looks of mild surprise, prompting Stonebeard to offer a half-smile. “Don’t look so shocked,” he rumbles. “Out here, we run a tight ship, which means everybody pitches in.”

Whisper, ever the quick study, steps forward. “What can I do? I have… some experience at sea,” she says humbly.

Stonebeard appraises her lithely efficient frame. “Help Haldor with the rigging. Keep those sails tight.”

Whisper nods and springs into action, her tabaxi agility well-suited to the task. The ropes hum under her deft hands as she climbs, earning an appreciative nod from Haldor.

Meanwhile, the rest of the crew— First Mate Ironfist, navigator Mera, chef Ingrid, and various deckhands— move about the deck with practiced ease.

Ingrid leans over the galley’s entrance, her voice booming, “Who among you knows their way around a kitchen?”

Scarlet raises a hand with a grin. “Cooking up something warm sounds perfect right now.”

Halite joins Scarlet in the kitchen, exchanging pleasantries with Ingrid as they prepare a hearty stew, the aroma rich with spices mingling in the cold air.

## The Snowy Plover

Doctor Pepe, Elara, and Kragor task themselves with learning to fish and find themselves manning nets off the stern. Doctor Pepe shows surprising adeptness, his agile hands working the rod with finesse. Kragor grumbles as he struggles. “Not a lot of fishing opportunities on the streets of Bladegarden,” he mutters.

From her perch in the rigging, Whisper calls down, “Think of it as a spell, Kragor. You might summon dinner if you concentrate.”

“Let’s see what fortune the sea brings today,” Elara says, her voice a melody in the crisp air. She casts her net with graceful precision, but as she retrieves it, only water glistens in the mesh. She sighs playfully, “Seems the ocean keeps its treasures close today.”

Kragor, determined, heaves his net overboard. As he reels it in, the weight drags heavily, a specter of uncertainty in its heft. “I’ve got something… big!” he calls over his shoulder, beads of sweat betraying the chill in the air.

Haldor steps forward to assist. Together with Kragor, they haul up a barnacle-encrusted mass, revealing an ornate anchor marked by worn letters: “.he ..owy plover”.

Whisper’s eyes gleam with recognition. “The Snowy Plover!” she breathes. “A privateer’s legacy that swims from the Empire’s grasp.” Captain Stonebeard approaches, rubbing his chin thoughtfully. “A fine addition to the Remorhaz,” he muses, a twinkle of approval in his gaze, subtly acknowledging their addition to his ship’s own lore.

Doctor Pepe, nearby, has his own triumph. With a flourish, he swings his net, bringing in an abundant bounty of writhing fish. The captain nods with a satisfied grunt, “You’ve caught us a week’s provisions!” he praises, gesturing with approval, the bounty speaking both to skill and a little ocean luck.

## The unexpected gourmet chef

Below deck, Chef Ingrid presides over her domain. Her moon-and-rune amulet clinks softly with each commanding gesture as she orchestrates the kitchen’s flurry. Her sharp eyes fall on Halite with an appraising gaze.

“We will teach you to cook as well,” Ingrid declares, her voice equal parts invitation and command. Halite accepts with a nod, curiosity threading through his response.

The galley vibrates with warmth as fragrant spices mingle with robust laughter. Ingrid’s movements are calculated, her precision bordering on ritual. She demonstrates methodically, seasoning with care, before stepping back to let Halite mimic her technique.

“Here, like this,” she says, her voice softer but firm. Halite mirrors her movements, expertly chopping vegetables that fall into place like a tactical formation.

Scarlet’s voice drifts from across the kitchen. “We could start a restaurant when this is all over!” she quips. Ingrid’s eyes twinkle, her demeanor lightening momentarily beneath her disciplined surface.

With her commanding presence softened by the shared endeavor, Ingrid stands back as Halite brings forward the fruits of their labor. A sprawling feast adorns the table: roasted fish glistening with savory oils, vegetables infused with spices that paint the air with hints of warmth and earth, and fresh bread golden from the oven’s embrace.

The first taste is met with a collective pause, a moment of reverent silence as each adventurer revels in the unexpected symphony of flavors. Elara’s eyes widen in delight, her laughter bubbling forth like a tinkling brook. “By the stars, what sorcery is this?” she exclaims, eyes twinkling as she savors another bite.

Kragor, usually so stoic, is visibly taken aback. “This could rival any feast in the finest halls of Bladegarden,” he marvels, his voice carrying genuine awe. His words are met with nods as the adventurers exchange glances of shared disbelief.

Whisper purrs a content approval between mouthfuls, while Doctor Pepe leans back, a rogue’s grin playing across his face. “Ingrid,” he declares, gesturing with a fork as though making a royal decree, “your skill turns humble fare into what can only be described as divine ambrosia.”

Ingrid, though gruff in service, allows herself a small, pleased smile, the mirrored amulet flickering in the candlelight like a secret torchbearer. “Serviceable, then?” she asks, her tone suggesting she knows the answer. Their enthusiasm is her silent reward.

Scarlet reaches for a second helping, her movements almost ceremonial. “I could believe this meal holds a druid’s magic,” she chuckles, daydreaming of such unparalleled bounty gracing her woodland home. The ship’s atmosphere thickens with camaraderie, each dish a testament to unearthing hidden talents amidst a tapestry of adventure.

## The bard performs

After the meal, the night sky sprawls over the ship like a grand tapestry spun from a dark magician’s loom, stars embedded in the fabric in shimmering constellations that dance in tune with the gentle swells of the sea below. The vessel cuts a silent path through the water, its sails billowing like the unfurled wings of a great celestial bird. In this nocturnal serenity, a vibrant scene unfolds upon the deck, a carnival of sounds and colors against the chiaroscuro of ocean and starlight.

Halite’s towering frame stands like a colossus, shoulders broad as the mountains he hails from, an immovable force that seems carved from the very granite of the earth. Yet, in one massive yet gentle hand, he lifts Elara, the aasimar bard, who appears almost ethereal in the moon’s tender glow. Her aura, radiant as the celestial heritage coursing through her veins, bathes the deck in a soft, heavenly light.

Adorned in a flowing ensemble similar to the garb of dryads and nymphs, Elara spins from Halite’s grasp, her skirts swirling like whirlwinds capturing the echoes of ancient songs. Her feet barely graze the timbers, yet it seems the deck itself moves to the rhythm of her bewitching performance. Her voice, a melody spun from the very essence of the world, soars above the susurration of the waves, captivating all who stand upon the ship.

The crew— seasoned sallies of the sea hardened by tempest and squall— find themselves utterly encharmed. Eyes wide and breath held captive, they move as if under a benevolent sorceress’s spell, their feet tapping and bodies swaying in conscious imitation of the bard’s ethereal dance. Even the ship’s wheel seems to turn more joyfully.

And at the helm stands Mera, the stoic navigator known for her stern direction and unwavering dedication to her charts and instruments. Tonight, she wears an entirely different visage; a wide smile has taken over her usually impassive face, her eyes twinkling with a mischievous delight as she observes the joyful tumult around her. She joins the rhythm, her hands leaving compass and astrolabe to clap in time with Elara’s intoxicating tune.

“You,” Mera announces in a voice weathered but warm. “Amidst these icy winds and unforgiving waves, you are by far the liveliest group with whom we’ve ever shared the deck!”

Laughter mingles with the music, a sparkling effervescence carried into the night sky where stars whisper together in secret harmony. Halite’s granite features soften, a rare smile tugging at his lips as he spins Elara round once more, her song reaching a crescendo that echoes through the firmament.

In the spellbound camaraderie, the boundaries of sea and sky seem to blur, the ship becoming an island of revelry upon endless waters. Tonight, time is forgotten, space itself woven by song and spirit into a tapestry of joyous unity. The Remorhaz sails on through silvered waves, a world unto itself, birthed from the enchantment of an aasimar’s song and a goliath’s strength — a moment between moments that the hearts of those aboard will treasure beyond the dawn.

## A flumph fever dream

Afterwards, as Scarlet drifts into a restless slumber, fevered dreams weave fantastical threads through her mind. In the surreal landscape of her unconscious, she finds herself transforming into a flumph, her human form dissolving into the distinctive shape of these peculiar, floating beings. Her senses shift; the world becomes a kaleidoscope of colors, each hue a different emotion, and telepathic whispers swirl around her like a distant echo.

Now a flumph, Scarlet navigates an otherworldly kitchen nestled in the heart of the Underdark. The cavern pulses with psychic energy, its inhabitants going about their mysterious lives. Scarlet floats through the air in gentle spurts, the gaseous propulsion emitting soft, rhythmic notes that resonate in harmony with her telepathic musings.

Her new perspective and abilities begin to stir a deep, intuitive understanding of the intricate flavors of the Underdark. Scarlet reaches out with her tendrils, sensing the psychic vibrations emanating from the local ingredients: savory spores from glowing mushrooms, rich and earthy undertones from cave lichens, and the briny essence of an underground spring. Her perceptions are heightened, each ingredient’s essence and potential reveal themselves in waves of color and emotion.

In this dreamscape kitchen, Scarlet crafts a symphony of dishes, her newfound culinary instincts guiding her every move. She stirs a bubbling cauldron of luminescent mushroom stew, the broth swirling in vibrant hues of satisfaction and warmth. As she experiments, her multifaceted consciousness coordinates each task, like a conductor leading an orchestra.

Drawing upon the flumph’s special abilities, Scarlet communicates with the ingredients, coaxing them to reveal their hidden qualities. Her telepathic link with the dishes allows her to adjust flavors with unprecedented precision, balancing the bold and the subtle into an intricate dance on the palate. She taps into the psychic currents, infusing each dish with the ambient energy, elevating the meal into a culinary experience both nourishing and enlightening.

Finally, the flumph-Scarlet presents her masterpiece: a feast of Underdark delicacies, arranged with an artist’s touch and glowing softly in the dim light. The once-doubtful abilities of this unassuming creature are now manifest in a banquet that transcends the boundaries of taste and experience.

As the fever dream weaves its finale, Scarlet’s consciousness begins to ebb back to reality, her experience as a flumph leaving an indelible mark on her aspirations and inspirations. Awakening with a start, she finds herself back in the familiar surroundings, her human body reclaimed but her gastronomic spirit forever expanded by the echoes of her uncanny adventure in the Underdark.

## Iron Chef

The day ushers in an overcast veil, casting the Remorhaz under an endless expanse of gray. The sky is a muddled canvas, flurries drifting lazily down to meet the gentle crests of the sea. It’s biting, the kind of chill that suggests secrets in the breathless air.

Whisper finds solace below deck alongside Haldor, the pair forming an unlikely camaraderie amidst the ship’s rhythmic creaking. “You know,” Haldor confesses, running a rough hand over the ropes that cling to the ship’s heart, “I’ve never seen a day without snow.”

Whisper turns, intrigued. “Truly? Not once?”

“Born in the snow, you see,” he continues wistfully. “Fishing’s in my blood, though. Glass Blades pay well, but nothing beats the quiet of a day spent fishing.”

Whisper listens, nodding. “Fishing has its own rhythm, doesn’t it?” she muses, picturing the warm southern waters of home, the sun casting lazy patterns across the surface— a stark contrast to Haldor’s icy tales.

“And there’s a warmth to the southern seas,” she begins, her voice a gentle tide of nostalgia. “The water embraces you like a friend you haven’t seen in years.”

Haldor considers this, in awe at the idea of swimming. “That… sounds wonderful,” he admits, a hint of longing in his tone. “I must learn these waters someday.” He demonstrates deft touches learned from a lifetime in frosty climes, showing Whisper how to deal with stubborn ice on ropes.

Elsewhere, the persistent patter guides Kragor to the deck, ever faithful to his fishing duty. A shiver sharpens his senses as he lugs a net overboard, focus unwavering. He hauls his catch— gleaming fish flash against the dismal gray, but something else captures his attention. Fingers close around an object crusted with barnacles, its form slowly revealing a brass oil lamp beneath encroaching life. “There’s something to polish,” he murmurs, weighing it in his palm, assessing the worth— a silver’s gain, perhaps.

Elara joins the hunt as well, casting her net into the swirling depths. But it is met with cruel resistance, the familiar fibers rending as surreptitious ocean claws yank them apart. Undeterred, Elara gathers with communal spirit, welcoming assistance from a few seasoned crew hands to mend and weave the net whole once more.

Halite, determined to make a good showing with the fishing nets, sharpens his focus amid the gathering chill. His efforts are rewarded as the net pulls taut, yielding a bounty— a marlin’s iridescent arch, the sleek bulk of tuna, and the peculiar speckled skin of musk flounder. The abundance draws the crew’s eyes, applause rippling through their ranks.

Scarlet’s net likewise yields a glistening cascade of writhing bounty, almost slipping free but held firm by her steady grasp. With an innate connection to all creatures, she soothes the catch with a gentle murmur, offering the ocean an understanding smile.

With the day’s fishing haul safely stowed, the adventurers gathered in the cozy warmth of the ship’s galley. Chef Ingrid, her eyes gleaming with both pride and purpose, addressed the group with a hearty smile.

“Gather ’round, my friends! The sea has been generous today, and in its honor, I extend an open invitation to you all,” she said, gesturing to the array of fresh fish before her. “Let us transform this bounty into a feast worthy of our journey. I’ll teach you the secrets of crafting a meal so fine, it will make the gods envious.”

The galley buzzes with a lively energy as the adventurers gather around Ingrid, who stands at the center like a maestro orchestrating her kitchen symphony. Each member of the party busies themselves with chopping, stirring, and seasoning under her watchful eye. She notes that three of her students are preternaturally adept at their tasks: Kragor, Halite, and Doctor Pepe.

Kragor, demonstrating a surprising delicacy of touch, carefully fillets a fish. “Didn’t know I’d be this good at anything other than swinging an axe,” he muses, more to himself than anyone else.

Ingrid nods approvingly, adjusting his grip slightly. “Precision is key, Kragor. A steady hand serves just as well in the kitchen as on the battlefield.”

Meanwhile, Halite methodically assesses the ingredients for the spice rub he’s crafting. “It’s akin to a strategic battle plan,” he observes thoughtfully, his deep voice carrying a hint of satisfaction. “Every seasoning plays its role, each with a purpose.”

“Well said, Halite,” Ingrid replies, watching him with admiration. “Strategy lies in simplicity and boldness, both in combat and in flavor.”

Nearby, Doctor Pepe expertly peels vegetables with the precision of a master thief disarming a trap. “Cooking feels like planning a perfect heist,” he jests, a mischievous glint in his eye. “Except the treasure is much tastier.”

Ingrid chuckles, nodding approvingly. “And you, Doctor Pepe, have certainly stolen the show with your deftness.”

As the aroma of the meal wafts through the galley, Ingrid gathers them around the table. “Feast your eyes and your senses, my friends,” she proclaims, gestures to the spread. “This is not just food. It’s the fruit of your labor, the spirit of your teamwork.”

Each adventurer beams with satisfaction, knowing they have not only fed their bellies but enriched their skills and camaraderie.

As he admires their handiwork and their instructor, Kragor’s curiosity is piqued an amulet dangling from Chef Ingrid’s neck. It is a grand silver talisman of a crescent moon alongside an array of arcane runes. His deep voice gruff yet oddly gentle, he asks “Chef Ingrid, what is that shiny thing around your neck? Looks... important.”

Ingrid replies, her gaze distant, anchored yet free. “Ah, a trifle,” she murmurs, the moon’s silver glow reflected softly within her eyes. “It is a simple reminder of my connection to the moon, nothing more.”

Kragor nodded slowly, satisfied with the simple explanation. “Ah, nice. Moon is... nice.”

Ingrid chuckled softly, her eyes momentarily distant as if recalling secrets long kept. But with Kragor content and unlikely to probe further, the moment passed.

## The Crick Queen’s Call

After enjoying the fabulous meal, the crew gathers on the main deck, their camaraderie weaving a tapestry of warmth against the chill of the open sea. The earlier formality fades into a congenial atmosphere, laughter echoing alongside the cry of seabirds. Captain Stonebeard himself joins the gathering, a rare smile playing on his lips as he observes.

Mera, the ship’s navigator, clears a space amidst the tarps and rigging, revealing a makeshift table cobbled together from wooden crates. “Shall we play ‘The Crick Queen’s Call’?” she suggests, her voice carrying the promise of an engaging diversion.

Elara, with her radiant aura, leans forward eagerly. “I’ve heard tales of this game,” she says. “A legendary pastime among sailors, named after a battle of wits and strategy as treacherous as any storm.”

Whisper remains aloft in the ship’s rigging, though she casts an interested glance downwards, her paws deftly knotting ropes as the vessel holds its course.

The players gather, each contributing a silver piece to the pot with varying degrees of confidence. Mera, eyes glinting with the competitive spirit kindled by seafaring lore, prepares for the opening gambit. Kragor’s tusks flash dangerously in the evening light, and he raises the stakes, the clink of additional silver accentuating his defiance.

Elara, Doctor Pepe, and Halite nod, accepting the silent challenge. They slide their tokens forward in a nuanced meeting of minds across the table. As the game unfolds, each move comes with a subtle dance of eyes and fingers, strategies and intentions woven through layered conversation and a rattle of coin.

Scarlet leans back from the table, her keen eyes watching the tides of fortune change. She murmurs a self-mocking, “Some hands are not best played,” as she folds, retreating from the game but not from the camaraderie.

Elara plays her cards with practiced elegance, her hands moving with the ease of her musical performances. The reveal of “The Even Hand” brings a chorus of appreciative groans and applause. “I hope you’re not always this lucky,” Kragor grumbles, though his tone holds amusement.

As coins shift to Elara’s side of the makeshift table, Doctor Pepe’s grin glints like a cat’s in shadows. “Time for a rematch,” he proposes, his voice both challenge and charm. Another round begins with five silver at stake, each adventurer’s spirit unbowed by their prior defeat.

Mera, Felisol, and Halite each push their modest luck, but notably Doctor Pepe’s luck swells this round, his hand revealing unexpected bounty. Bags full of unspent potential tip in his favor, and his victory garners applause and congratulation from all.

“Looks like you’ve kept a few tricks hidden, rogue,” Elara observes with a teasing smile, acknowledging their shared cunning in the merry company of allies.

The game winds down as the night deepens, and finally adventurers and crew alike retire to their bunks.

## Shapes shift in the night

In the heart of night, a cacophony of crashing and banging pierces the quietude of slumber, echoing ominously through the chambers of the ship. The noise cascades down the corridors like a rogue wave. Halite and Kragor awaken with a jolt, immediately vigilant as they identify the disturbance as emanating from the kitchen. Within moments, they nudge Elara and Scarlet into wakefulness.

Alert and battle-ready, Halite takes point, leading the quartet down the narrow, creaking passageway to the kitchen. There, as the lamplight spills through the doorway, they behold First Mate Ironfist and Haldor, both wide-eyed and tense with faces set like stone, confronting an icy-furred adversary— a fearsome winter wolf with eyes burning frost-blue.

Kragor’s gaze darts about, landing on Ingrid’s amulet, discarded and glinting forlornly on the floor beside one of the bunks. His brows furrow in recognition and curiosity. Without hesitation, he whispers a few arcane words, summoning a protective embrace of magical frost that envelops him, shimmering with power.

Next, Kragor conjures a spectral, floating hand and sends it rush past the wolf in an attempt to use the ethereal appendage as a distraction. The wolf, however, remains undeterred, its focus shifting toward Ironfist with almost predatory tunnel vision, yet restraint holds its posture for the moment.

Sensing a chance for diplomacy, Elara plucks a few strings of her harp and chants “Vobiscum natura loquor”. Her voice then rings soft yet authoritative, seeking connection. “Calm, my friend, we mean you no harm. How can we help you?” But the wolf regards her with unwavering silence— this creature is not born of mere wild instinct. An unspoken tension thrums through the air as it seems moments away from lunging.

Scarlet withdraws a yew leaf from her pouch. She presses it to her forehead, eyes closing as if to draw insight from ages past. Her arm extends gracefully, the leaf circling counterclockwise before her heart. In a swift flick of her wrist, she casts the energy outward. Her voice resonates through the cabin: “Oculi Naturae, aperite ad veritatem; quod latent, patefaciat.” A subtle gleam envelops her, the spell woven, as she opens her senses to all signs of poison and disease. Her senses find a darker truth beneath fur and fang: lycanthropy dances along the wolf’s essence, a curse as old as time.

The commotion draws more of the crew, Captain Stonebeard included. "What the hey??" he exclaims.

Understanding dawns as suspicion edges Scarlet’s voice: “I think… that… That’s Chef Ingrid!”

Whisper, earlier roused by the clamor, stealthily emerges, taking stock of the escalating scene. She moves with feline grace, fluidly dodging her companions to retrieve the amulet. She pivots, holding out the amulet and asking Haldor with uncertainty, “This should be with Ingrid, shouldn’t it?”

Haldor glances at the amulet, confusion clouding his features. “Ingrid holds that dearer than anything,” he says, clearly puzzled. “She’d never be without it willingly.”

Whisper attempts to withdraw and take the amulet to safety, but the startled wolf lunges, its jaws closing around her arm with a merciless bite. Agony explodes through her senses, and she collapses to the floorboards, desperately clawing for traction to right herself.

In the chaos, Halite takes swift action. With practiced precision, he hurls his net, ensnaring the wild beast in a tangle of coarse fibers.

Kragor sprints forward, snatching the gleaming amulet from Whisper’s trembling grasp. Intent on his objective, he attempts to fasten it around the wolf’s neck, yet the snaring net hinders his movements. Even as he wrestles with the tangled mess, the wolf thrashes free, its eyes ablaze with the primal instinct to flee. It stands cornered, frantic and dangerous.

Amidst the tumult, Elara approaches with an uncanny tranquility. With a deft and unwavering hand, she settles the amulet upon the wolf’s neck. As its fangs snap perilously close to her, an ancient magic unfurls; the transformation is violent and beautiful. Muscles ripple and contort beneath the sleek fur, bones audibly crack and reform with a sickening yet mesmerizing fluidity. The lupine snout retracts painfully back into a familiar dwarven face, eyes flicker from feral to intelligent with startling clarity. The beast’s savage growls fade into anguished cries as claws withdraw into slender fingers. In mere moments, the fearsome beast dissolves to reveal Ingrid, collapsed and vulnerable, her form shivering under the strain of the metamorphosis.

Silence reins as Ingrid stands, sheepish and shivering, caught between fear and relief. Elara, compassion in her heart, drapes a blanket over the chef’s shoulders. Captain Stonebeard, with weary authority and a tone brooking no argument, commands, “Everyone back to bed! Nothing to see here!”

As the adventurers retreat upstairs, faintly echoing behind them is the Captain’s low voice, tinged with inevitable frustration, “Well why the hells didn’t you tell me before??”
