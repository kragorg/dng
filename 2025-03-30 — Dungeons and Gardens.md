# The next chapter

it is late afternoon around dinner time

whisper suggests, let’s go back to the docks gramini and ask about the powder

gramini has framed the t-shirt, and below it there is an autographed card with lipstick “thanks for coming, scanlon shorthalt”. for sale at 500gp.

halite seeks her expertise on some potentially magical items. gramini says it is beyond my ken. retailer. but old man westeroff was once a wizard… he retired up here. he could do identify for an item for some coin. not a great town for smart and meddlesome types. kragor asks where westeroff resides. gramini points up the hill and says his house has red shutters. back past the jolly dwarf and towards the cliffs. “cliffside.”

we also ask about where to find elro. it is next to city hall/prison/tax center.

we find elro. elara explains their adventures in the cavern. elro is flattered by her manner. she says it costs us quite a bit more than expected. but elro found the deranged dwarf with his hands tied running out of town. he’s now in jail, one of the glass blades found him.

elara explains the big frogs were a challenge, and that we took out the elf bandits, the acolyte, and the priestess.

75gp bounty

kragor blurts out, do you know irven liel? elro has not heard of him. we mention the vials and the blue powder.

elro will message uthodorn and some outpost on eiselcross about it.
meanwhile, check at the inns.

the party heads back towards the jolly dwarf. we see Arl Bortock behind the bar, and the mixed family again.
elara says we would like to get dinner. six silver pieces.
she asks about the family.
oh the liels? they are booksellers. they are on the way to uthodrun.
halite “i fancy myself a reader”.
they are irven liel, fenton something, honor & magic are the girls.

we have samples, and we take orders, and ship to stores. i’m a wholesaler.
gramini is going to stock some of our best sellers.
whisper blurts out “how about vials?”
irven: “uh who have you been talking to? i don’t know about this?”
elara “what kind of books?”
irven: “feather leather is flying off the shelf”

halite says he loves books. disappointed that he’s not a retailer.

elara: we are on a quest to solve the popsicle sickness.
we came across some blue vials, and your name is connected to it.

irven: i hope the sickness is not connected. and he glances at a daughter.
halite suggests we have a private conversation.
irven: daddy’s selling some books and let’s fenton teflick take care of the girls.

irven shows the blue vial. i bought this from a woman named hulil who needed money quick. we met her on the road.
we can see a crack in the vial.
irven: is this related to the disease?
halite: what did halil tell you this was?
irven: she said it was magical dust from aeor and would fetch a big price. he did notice that the vial was cracked at the time, but felt it still was a great price. 40gp. I hoped to sell it for 500gp.

whisper suggests that he allows scarlet to cast the spell to detect the disease.

irven says my whole family has touched this!
scarlet casts the spell and she knows it is the same magical contagion as in the chest.

scarlet tells irven the bad news.

doctor pepe takes the vial into his pouch gently. the vial is mostly empty.
scarlet suggests that irven have quality time with the children.

halite asks if anyone in the family has felt any symptoms.

whisper suggests that elara talk arl into a deep clean.

elara also gives irven some hope that we will find a cure and come back. “you have met the right people.”

irven says he can get us a signed copy of feather leather.

we short rest. Kragor and Halite study the Aeorian dagger.
Halite says: not a scratch on it, could be magical.

we also look at the scroll case. inlaid cover. the cover is inlaid with a map of the multiverse from before the calamity. it must be 2–3 thousand years old. but it is empty.
the jade statuette of a storm giant. quiver of +1 arrows.
silver ring set with jasper stone. we can tell from the scratches and wear that it is likely not magical, but worth 50gp.

arl comes out with dinner and maybe his son carrying it. salt fish and tentacles, bread, and such.

halite explains the situation with arl and recommends that he clean the inn.
arl panics a little, and elara calms him down.
he does suggest that we tell elro, and then runs into the back to start cleaning.

we finish dinner and start head out to see the wizard.
erlo meets us. he got word back, and has some information to share.
the disease is called frigid woe, and it originates in aeor. it is known about on eiselcross. there is a cure: a milky white liquid that the aeorians store in golden vials. if you go back to where urgon got the vials, the cure might be there.
elro suspects that, since the aeorians hated the gods, this was some experimental magic to fight the gods.
he gives us 100gp for solving the mystery.

we all understand that it takes 60 days for the disease to progress. it is spread with contact by the powder, not person to person.

we explain that irven’s family has handled the powder.

elro wants to hire our group to go to eiselcross and find the cure. he has a small ship we can use called “Remorhaz”.
elro asks if we can account for all of the powder. we tell him about the vials we know of.
I will give you 200gp to try to find the cures.

elara suggest we may need more than 200gp …
elro: “I’ll tell you what. I need to get those vials off the streets. I will give you 200gp for those vials.” the party agrees to sell.

elara says to elro please look after the family.

## milestone reached

Kragor preps fiendish vigor. Scarlet summons an owl.

We go Mathias’s Stuffs.
Looks like a barn with a lot a of junk, kind of like a consignment shop.
There is an unkempt elf behind the counter with a goatee.
When we walk in he is noting inventory.

Elara introduces us.

Kragor requests: armor? No studded leather armor.
Elara says do you have any armor to fit my figure?
Mathias is impressed and has elven leather armor only.
Whisper asks for a quarterstaff (2 sp). Mathias rips the head off a spear and offers that.
Halite requests javelins, and he has three for 15 sp.
doctor pepe gets a two billed olive drab hat for 1sp.

Doctor Pepe and Scarlet take one each of the scimitars that we found.
offering 3 scimitars at 12gp each,
and 6 crossbows at 30gp each.

we also ask for one month provisions at 15gp, 5gp for 100 bolts (doctor pepe), and 5gp for 100 arrows (elara).

kragor asks for advice about eiselcross.
the wild folk there are pretty harmless and want to be let be. but there are some with black streaks in their face that are aggressive and violent.

elara asks mathias about westeroff. he’s a nice old guy.

now the party goes to westeroff’s place.
the place has a couple of runes above the door.

halite knocks on the door while elara plays her harp.
a voice “what are you kids doing, get off of my stoop!”
the door opens and a old gnome stopped over asks what we want.
please put that harp away!
halite goes to eye level. we need your help.
can you tell us anything about this scroll case?
it is beautiful, it is from the age of arcana, where did you get this?
is it from aeor?
yes. this is a fantastic specimen.

we explain that we want to identify the dagger.
he invites us in.
halite bumps his head.

kragor hands the dagger to gnome, who admires it.
it’ll cost you 5 gp to identify (kragor’s personal stash).
we agree to pay.
the gnome casts Identify with a pearl and a feather.
this dagger helps you stab. +1 dagger.

he dismisses the statue and ring as mundane.

we ask him about frigid woe and the vials.
another wizard who came from there told me that it looked like an Aeorian experiment to use against the gods and their armies.
scarlet inquires about golden vials and milky white liquid? well i have heard of that but that is all i know.

whisper asks about potions for sale. mathias shows one bottle that looks pretty gross. it is a potion of hill giant strength for 500 gp.

doctor pepe pulls the gnome aside. uses 5 gp to identify a red garnet behind the party’s back.

halite buys a crystal aspirationally for a spell focus for 10 gp (halite’s personal stash).

kragor mentions to the gnome our mission.
in response, the gnome offers some potions of healing for 50 gp each.

the party heads to the docks to meet the ship.

elro has arranged passage Remorhaz (a burrowing worm that is an ambush predator).
heading to the outpost of syrinlya on ?.
elro says talk to orvo mustave. he has gone on many expeditions into eiselcross with urgon.
once you find the cure, use what you need if you are afflicted, but bring the rest back. there’s an uthodornian elf called “The Buyer” who can teleport the cure immediately back to Palebank.
elro says it is even colder in eiselcross than here.
kragor asks, are snowshoes advisable?
there is a river of lava on the continent where the ice is thin, so snowshoes can be very useful.
scarlet asks how big the town is? 250 people or so.
it will take four days of travel.

the party is brought on board the ship, which is a small ship with a ballista fore and after. whisper has a look at the boat, and she can see it is a fast ship meant for scouting and message transport.

we meet captain stonebeard. he is very obsequious while elro is around. first mate ironfist. merra the navigator. chef ingrid downstairs. haldor is another crew hand.
the crew prepares the ship’s three sails.

as soon as we are out in the harbor, the captains demeanor changes. I’m in charge and no one rides without helping us. Whisper asks what she can do to help.
you can do rigging, so help haldor. the rest of you landlubbers learn how to fish and cook.

elara, doctor pepe, and kragor go fishing with nets. elara pulls up nothing. kragor’s net snags something incredibly heavy, i call help from halite.
together we pull up something (100 lbs+), it is a fancy anchor. it had the ship’s name in it. “.he ..owy plover” … Whisper says, that must be The Snowy Plover.
That was a reknowned privateer that preyed on Dwendalian Empire ships until it had to flee. captain stonebeard thinks the anchor will make a nice addition to his ship.
doctor pepe gets a huge net of fish, like a week’s worth of fish.
points with stonebeard.

chef ingrid, obviously very OCD, is an older dwarf woman with a large moon+rune amulet. silver with like green. she is mad chef’ing the others in the galley.
very matronly. She points to Halite and says “We will teach you to cook as well.”
we are amazed at the food.

Scarlet has a fever dream about a flumpf.

Halite carries Elara with one hand while she performs a dance.
The crew is mesmerized. All their cool is gone.
“You guys are the most fun group we have ever had!”

the day is cloudy without much visibility. it is a bit cold with slight flurries.
the ship makes good time, but we all stay indoors.

whisper and haldor hang out. he’s never seen a day without snow. he has fished his all life. but glass blades pay really well for this work. it is awesome to fish tho, and everyone should learn to fish.
haldor shows whisper some tricks for dealing with ice on the ropes.
whisper explains the warmth of southern waters and haldor is amazed.

kragor is on fishing duty again today. he pulls up a few fish as well as a gold object. a few barnacles are on a brass oil lamp that looks like it needs cleaning.
seems worth 1 silver or so.

halite also fishes. he brings up a nice large load of fish: marlin, tuna, musk flounder, etc.

elara throws the net, but finds it broken. she works on mending it with the help of the crew.

scarlet nets a bunch of fish, almost dropping it, but recovering.

chef ingrid is so happy with the catches. cooking lessons for everybody.
Cooking proficiency earned by Kragor, Halite, and Doctor Pepe.
We also each get cooking utensils.
The crew is very impressed at several of the students making it through this school.

Kragor asks about Chef Ingrid’s amulet. “Just a trifle, it reminds me of my connection to the moon.”

The crew was previously cordial but are now quite warm and invite us to play “The Krick Queen’s Call”. The game is named after one of the biggest battles of the Calamity, around the Krynn dynasty.

Merra plays with the party while Whisper stays sailoring.
Everyone antes 1 silver piece (= 6sp)
Kragor raises 1 silver piece (= 1sp)
Elara, Doctor Pepe, Halite call (= 3sp). Scarlet folds.
Elara wins the hand with The Even Hand (10 sp)!

All but Elara and Doctor Pepe antes (= 5sp).
Everyone stays in for a silver piece (= 5sp).
This round Doctor Pepe wins (10 sp)!

As we all sleep, we hear crash, banging in the middle of the night, seems to come from the kitchen. Halite and Kragor hear the noise, and wake Elara and Scarlet.
Halite leads us to the kitchen where we find Ironfist and Haldor awake and facing a winter wolf.

Kragor sees lying on the floor next to one the bunks Ingrid’s amulet.

Whisper wakes up.

Kragor casts AoA and tries to distract the wolf with a sound from Prestidigitation, but the wolf does not fall for my trick.
The wolf moves looking at Ironfist, but does not attack.

Elara casts Speak with Animals and asks the wolf, “Calm my friend, we mean you no harm. How can we you help you?”
The wolf looks at Elara, but says nothing in response. It looks like it might lunge at any second.

Scarlet casts Detect Poison and Disease on the winter wolf. She senses lycanthropy.

More of the crew wake: Captain Stonebeard. “What the hey??” We mention that we think it is Ingrid.

Whisper agilely scampers across the walls to pass the other party members and enter the room. She sees the amulet. She asks Haldor, “Should that amulet be on her?” Haldor says “What? I have never seen Ingrid without that amulet!”

Whisper engages her feline agility to grab the amulet and retreats. The wolf is startled and bites Whisper for 11 points of damage. Heavily wounded, she is thrown prone for a moment as a result, but is able to recover her stance.
Halite throws his net over the wolf and restrains it.

Kragor runs towards Whisper, grabs the amulet, and attempts to put the amulet around the wolf’s neck, but the net gets in the way.

The wolf shakes off the net, and snarls as it backs into the corner.

Elara grabs the amulet, and this time she successful at putting it around the wolf’s neck. It turns to snap at her, but as that happens, the wolf transforms back into Ingrid, naked.

Ingrid stands there sheepish and exhausted. Elara covers her with a blanket. The Captain yells, “Everyone back to bed! Nothing to see here!”
As we all go upstairs, we hear the Captain saying “Why didn’t you tell me before??”
