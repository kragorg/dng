<h2 id="eggs">Eggs</h2>
<p>Dragons lay eggs in small clutches, the exact number varying
according to the kind of dragon. Females can lay eggs as often as once
per year but rarely do so that frequently. Dragons have a greater degree
of influence over their own reproductive systems than humanoids do.
Although a female dragon cannot completely control whether or not mating
produces fertile eggs, the chance of fertilization falls dramatically if
the dragon does not wish to reproduce.</p>
<p>One of the parents—usually the female—typically locates the nest deep
in the lair. The nest consists of a mound or pit where the parent
gathers the eggs and buries them in sand, dirt, snow, leaves, or
whatever medium is best suited to the dragon and to the environment.</p>
<p>The average dragon egg is about the size of a small rain barrel. Eggs
normally have the same color as the dragon variety, though somewhat
duller in hue. They are roughly ovoid and have a texture somewhere
between dragon scale and stone.</p>
<p>When first laid, a dragon egg has resistance to the damage type
produced by the parents’ breath weapon (acid for black dragons, fire for
red, and so on). (Mixed breed dragon eggs have resistance to one
parent’s damage type, and don’t survive if the other parent is
incautious with his or her breath.) As the egg nears hatching, the shell
grows harder but more brittle, and that resistance diminishes. By the
time the wyrmling is ready to hatch, the egg has no resistance at
all.</p>
<p>Incubation time varies according to the variety of dragon. In all
cases, the eggs are fertilized inside the female and are ready for
laying roughly one-quarter of the way through the incubation period.</p>
<p><img src="white-dragon-hatch.png" /></p>
<h2 id="hatching">Hatching</h2>
<p>When a wyrmling is ready to hatch, it begins feeding on the inside of
the egg’s shell, absorbing the remaining nutrients. This activity
strengthens the young dragon and weakens the shell. The wyrmling then
breaks free by clawing at the sides, pressing against and cracking the
shell with brute strength, and blasting the shell occasionally with its
own already developed breath weapon.</p>
<h2 id="wyrmling">Wyrmling</h2>
<p>A newly hatched dragon has a full array of abilities. Although
inferior to those of a young dragon, these abilities are sufficient for
the wyrmling to take care of itself, at least against relatively weak
threats and predators. Although an emerging wyrmling is sodden and
somewhat awkward, it can run within hours of hatching and can fly within
a day or two. A wyrmling’s senses are fully acute, and—due to the
interweaving of a dragon’s centers of memory and instinct—it is born
with a substantial amount of its parents’ knowledge imprinted in its
mind.</p>
<p>Even so, a dragon is not born with the full memories of prior
generations. Rather, a wyrmling has a grasp of the generalities of the
world and of its own identity. It knows how to move, how to use its
innate abilities, who and what its parents are, and—perhaps most
important—how to view the world around it. This awareness is one reason
that even the youngest dragons are capable of surviving to adulthood. It
is also why a sense of superiority and arrogance is ubiquitous among
chromatic dragons: They are born already knowing that they’re among the
most powerful creatures in the world (or at least will be, after they
mature).</p>
<p>Parents might accompany a wyrmling on its earliest hunts, to protect
it and to make certain it knows how to hunt efficiently. Wyrmlings left
to fend for themselves and wyrmlings that don’t have protective parents
still must leave the nest within a few days of hatching to find food. By
the third or fourth foray, even solicitous dragon parents let wyrmlings
hunt on their own, lest the wyrmlings grow too dependent on parental
assistance.</p>
<p>Wyrmlings spend a few years dwelling with one or both of their
parents. Some parents welcome this time as an opportunity to teach their
offspring lessons beyond its inherited knowledge: the best areas to
hunt, what to look for in a lair, how to begin building a hoard, and
other knowledge a growing dragon needs to gain. Other parents look on
wyrmlings as necessary evils: competitors for resources and for space in
the lair that must nevertheless be tolerated for a brief time. Only evil
dragons that lack any parenting instinct—in dragonkind, a mild form of
insanity—consider forcing a wyrmling to leave the nest early. This
condition is most common in black and gray dragons but rare even among
them.</p>
<p>A wyrmling whose parents abandoned it before it hatched or could not
care for it after it hatched takes longer to hone its abilities. It
still has the advantage of its inherited instincts, but the lack of a
teacher makes perfecting its abilities an arduous task. Some wyrmlings
manage to do so on their own, through trial and error. Others seek out
mentors of their own kind. Even an evil dragon might willingly take on a
short-term apprentice if the younger dragon shows adequate respect, such
as gifts of treasure scavenged or stolen from any source the young
dragon can manage. These relationships rarely last more than a few
months, because the older dragon inevitably begins to view the younger
one as a rival. The younger dragon either departs or ends up on the
menu.</p>
<p>Although wyrmlings are small and weak by dragon standards, a wyrmling
is roughly the size of a large wolf or a full-grown human. Even at their
youngest, dragons have few natural predators. For full statistics on
chromatic dragon wyrmlings, see pages 179—186.</p>
<h2 id="about-white-dragons">About White Dragons</h2>
<p>White dragons—also called ice dragons or glacial wyrms—have a
reputation as dull, stupid creatures. They do not deserve it. Although
white dragons are remarkably bestial, they are as intelligent as other
chromatic dragons. They care little for intricate schemes or political
power, preferring to live their lives as hunters and collectors of
treasure. They rely more on instinct than on intellect. Although they
still live long and look to the distant future, they do not worry about
the future to the extent that their cousins do. They prefer merely to
keep themselves comfortably fed and housed.</p>
<p>Like all capable predators, white dragons are masters of their
territories. They know the good hiding spots and optimal ambush points.
They hunt not only well, but brutally. They kill swiftly and
efficiently. They lack the cruelty of black dragons and the ferocity of
reds. They also lack those dragons’ inclination to engage with or
manipulate intruders or neighbors. Unless potential victims quickly
offer solid reasons not to kill them, white dragons likely slay first,
eat second, and never consider asking questions. The few offers known to
have saved fast-talking travelers included gifts of gems with promises
of more gems to come or, even better, gifts and promises of more meat
than the travelers themselves would provide if eaten.</p>
<p>Like all chromatic dragons, white dragons look down on other
creatures. In the white dragon’s case, this attitude is evidence of its
tendency to view all living creatures as potential prey. Prey is, after
all, inferior to the hunter strong enough to eat it. Rarely, if ever,
can a community negotiate peaceful coexistence with a white dragon whose
territory borders it. Members of a community might have a slim chance of
convincing a dragon to leave their livestock alone, at least for a
while, if they display a significant show of force or give a truly
magnificent bribe. Barring these options, however, nothing but the
dragon’s death can stop it from hunting the people’s herd animals—and
probably the people themselves.</p>
<p>As animalistic hunters, white dragons have little preference among
types of prey. They attack and eat the most convenient creatures worth
the trouble of killing. Because farmers’ cattle offer a lot more meat,
they interest a white dragon more than the farmers themselves—but a
dragon does not balk at eating available sentient beings. White dragons
prefer frozen foods, burying their prey in snowbanks or walls of ice for
days or weeks before consuming it.</p>
<p>White dragons possess a few traits not purely predatory. Like reds
and blues, they have especially long memories for grudges and insults.
They might seek revenge for slights many years after erring parties have
forgotten them.</p>
<p>White dragon eggs incubate for a period of roughly fourteen months,
the first three and a half of which they spend within the female’s body.
White dragons lay clutches of eight to ten eggs each, but only a quarter
to a third of them survive until they hatch. A white dragon’s wyrmling
stage lasts for three or four years. The young stage lasts until the age
of one hundred. An adult dragon becomes an elder at roughly 750 years,
and an elder becomes ancient at about 1,700. White dragons have been
known to live as much as 2,100 years.</p>
<h2 id="wyrmlings">Wyrmlings</h2>
<p>When a newly hatched dragon emerges from the egg, it is sodden in
nutritive fluids and slightly stiff from never before having flexed its
muscles. Within the day, though, the awkward wyrmling transforms into a
creature already in possession of a full suite of powers and fully
conscious of its surroundings. Wyrmlings are sometimes confused with
drakes or mundane reptilian creatures, but not for long.</p>
<p>White dragons grow quickly but are more ferocious than cunning; most
die before maturing. White wyrmlings are nasty blights of cold and
bestial hunger that blow in with cold weather out of the mountains,
looking for food and treasure. A white wyrmling’s head crest is less
pronounced than an adult’s, and its throat and chin are smoothly scaled,
lacking the dewlap and spike of an adult. It has only a hint of horns on
the ridges over its eyes and ears. The rest of its body has yet to
develop scales and is instead protected by leathery white hide.</p>
<p>A white dragon lays its eggs in a cold, remote location. Although low
temperature is not necessary for the eggs to hatch, it does season the
wyrmlings to their environment and might be necessary for developing
resistance to cold. Ice caves in glaciers are best, but deep crevasses
or hollows in frozen tundra can also serve. After a clutch of white
wyrmlings hatches, the creatures take a few hours to clean themselves
and gather their strength. But within the day, they are out of the
hatchery, hunting for their first meals.</p>
<p>White wyrmlings have a chilling breath weapon that slows and weakens
foes just like that of mature whites, and they can also lash out with a
flurry of claws and fangs. However, they can’t call upon the frigid
power of older dragons. Like red wyrmlings, they fight to the bitter
end, and sometimes their brutality can help them win out.</p>
<p>Sometimes kobolds attempt to tame a white dragon hatched from a
plundered egg. This tactic often ends poorly for the would-be
dragontamer, but occasionally it succeeds. Dragonborn sometimes are able
to work with white wyrmlings and keep them as pets, although the
creatures are too vicious and unpredictable for civilized environments.
Occasionally white wyrmlings are encouraged by blandishments of treasure
and food to briefly join forces with minor intelligent undead.</p>
