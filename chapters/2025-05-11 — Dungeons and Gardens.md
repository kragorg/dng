Whisper purchased four pounds of oil for 5 silver pieces from Javel.

Hanging out at the yurt now after going to Javel.

We get word from the Captain of the Remorhaz
that it will be several weeks to repair the ship.
(Four more weeks.)
They hired Gerhardt’s one surviving crew member.

Getting ready to bunk down. Gerhardt knows there’s nothing else he can do so he is joining us.
It’s been five days since we left Palebank Village.
Salsvalt is on the same side of the lava river as we are, so we won’t have to cross.

It seems self in the encampment.
We decide to have a drink of the Sandkeg’s High,
and ask Elara to play us a tune.



## Kragor’s monologue

Alright. Listen up. I’s got something to say.

You all know I gets magic from… from some powerful being.
But I never told you how, or why I came here. Up north.
Not your business!
But now… things are getting weird. Bad weird.
And I think keeping secret might get you all killed.
And then I dies too, ’cause we stuck together now.

I come on this journey after many, many moons of strange sleeps when I live on streets of Bladegarden.
Hearin’ whispers.
Bad dreams full of dark shapes that know my name.
Seein’ stars fallin’.
Big, weird things just outta reach.
And somethin’ there, watching. Always watching.

Then, on very dark night, some man-whelps try kill me.
I not want to die like nobody.
Just another forgotten orc.
I was scared. Nearly dead. So I yell into darkness...
I give up to... whatever thing watching.

Then I feel it!
Cold like night but... nice.
Wrap around me like black smoke.
It whisper secrets in strange talk I not know.
Power fill me up inside!

I ain’t sorry at all when I smash stupid face in
right then and there
with a war hammer that just appeared in my fist,
then blasted the other scum with dark cracklin’ magic
that sent ’em runnin’ like scared rabbits.

But I know magic like that has a cost.
Dreams keep coming. Still make no sense.
But dreams tell me “Go north.”
“Go to Eiselcross.”
Don’t know why exactly.
Maybe find somethin’.
Maybe smash somethin’.

But comrades… new dreams now. Worse dreams.
More than dreams.

Back at that tavern, the Jolly Dwarf, some night I sleep bad.
Couldn’t remember what I dreamed, but when I woke up…
fingers had dirt under nails. Broken nails. Don’t make no sense!

Then on the big boat, the Remorhaz, crossin’ the ice-sea.
Woke up in the night.
But not in my bed!
I was… somewhere else.
Couldn’t move.
Felt like mountains of ice pressin’ down on me.
Hearin’ ice crackin’.
For a long time, I couldn’t even feel myself breathing.
Couldn’t scream.
No dream.
Felt like I was locked away.
Buried under ice.
Then, snap! Back in my bunk.
And again, dirt under my nails!
Dirt that shouldn’t be there… couldn’t be there!
Whatever got its claws in me…
it’s doin’ something with my body when I sleepin’.
And that ain’t good for any of us.

## Continues

Elara is fascinated with the story and suggests that bunking together would be a good idea.

There is discussion of what this all means.
Should we tie Kragor up?
Should we keep close watch on him.

Elara plays us a lullaby.

Gerhardt takes first watch.
Nothing eventful happens, other than Gerhardt realizes there is a snorer in the group.

Halite takes second watch.
Camp sounds are normal, folks occassionally going out to relieve themselves.

Elara takes third watch.
She watches Kragor closely.
Nothing to notice.

Scarlet takes fourth watch.
At the end of the watch she hears people getting ready for the day.

Morning dawns, nothing abnormal occurred … Kragor’s nails are clean.

## On to Salsvalt

The party heads out at normal speed.

Gerhardt prepares rations so everyone can enjoy lunch.

Scarlet sends Sparky out to investigate and scout up ahead.
Sparky is accustomed to woods,
but the snowy wilderness is unfamiliar to him.
And there is nothing but snow the first day… not even rocks or cliffs.

We set up camp. Half-moon of the major moon (Catha). Catha is associated with the Moon Weaver.
Ruinous is the small moon and it is full— a moon of ill tidings.

Doctor Pepe has few opinions and is happy just to go along. lol.

The next day, during one of Whisper’s watches, you see a bright light flying from east to west.
She reports it after the watch is over.

Morning on day 2.

Halite helps us navigate a steep cliff face, using the grappling check to rope over it.
He is amazing and crawls up the cliff face and helps everyone over quickly.

At the end of the day, the evening is cloudy… quiet.
Other than being fucking cold, the party sleeps well.
But during her watch, Elara notices Kragor
tossing turning
then curled into fetal position.
When he wakes up, Kragor’s fingernails are again caked with mud.
We have seen no mud.

Day 3 of travel:
Gerhardt helps somehow, I forget how.

The party comes upon a couple of rock formations, about 10' tall.
