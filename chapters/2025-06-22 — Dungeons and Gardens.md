still on day 3

At the foothills of some mountains.
A clear day.

Dr Pepe and Scarlet hear something that sounds like wolves. But not a normal yip, sounds like a cry of pain. Then abruptly stops.

Now we see a white wolf far in the distance, it seems to be running away looking behind it.
A cloud of steam and a cry from the wolf. Suddenly the wolf disappears in the steam.

Elara casts Guidance on Dr. Pepe and then moves behind an outcropping.

Scarlet sends Sparky out to have a look, and looks through the owl’s eyes.
Looking down at the steam, it is localized, and there is something blue. Like a small 8' cylinder radius 10' high where the wolf had been.

Kragor takes position alongside Elara and prepares to blast anything he sees.

Doctor Pepe dashes as far as he can and hides.

Whisper also rushes past Doctor Pepe and hides against another outcropping, and hides.

The steam dissipates.

Halite rushes up to the other side of the outcropping that Whisper is next to.

Gerhard realizes we’re dealing with a remorhaz. And yells to the rest of the party. Whisper & Elara & Kragor & Doctor Pepe hear.

Elara makes a sound using minor illusion. Almost like the thumper from dune, 10ft from Halite.

Scarlet also recognizes that this is a remorhaz.

Kragor continues holding on his eldritch blast.

Doctor Pepe readies his bow.

Whisper stows her snow shoes and climbs up the outcropping about 10ft.

Suddenly the remorhaz appears where the thumping was happening. Halite feels a wave of heat coming from the creature and the tip of his nose burns red.

Doctor Pepe fires his crossbow and pierces the remorhaz (6 damage).
The arrow burned away.

Kragor blasts for (11 damage).

The remorhaz is furious.

Halite retreats 25 ft away from the remorhaz, near to Elara.
He throws his javelin (8 damage), which is destroyed with contact.
Reduced remorhaz movement by 10 ft.

Gerhard casts hunter’s mark and fires his longbow (15 damage). Hits base of an antenna.

Elara fires her shortbow (8 damage), then inspires Scarlet.

Scarlet casts entangle. Vines fly from her hands to remorhaz and briefly encircle the creature. It immediately burns through the vines.

Kragor hexes the worm and blasts it. (11 damage)
It is looking hurt.

Doctor Pepe fires at the remorhaz and hits it again. (9 damage)
Then he hides.

Whisper pops out from the outcropping briefly and slings a bullet at the remorhaz. (5 damage)

The remorhaz rushes Halite and attempts to bite off his head, but misjudged the height and missed. Halite takes 4 fire damage.
He then swings his trident, but distracted by the heat, he misses.
With action surge, he swings again, making a solid hit (critical).
Halite takes 7 fire damage.
But the trident goes into the skull of remorhaz (29 damage).
Second wind to heal up.

On examination of the corpse, Scarlet realizes that the scales could be used for portions of fire resistance; and that it can be dangerous to remove them. Scarlet removes three scales but also nicks a gland, taking 4 fire damage.

Whisper finds a great windless sheltering niche in the mountains. On stone, not snow.

We have covered 72 miles by now.

Starting day four. The day is clear and the wind is moderate.

Kragor sends out his mage hand to avoid hazards. But not good enough. Halite falls through the snow up to his neck. We spend half the day digging him out. We only go 12 miles… a total of 84 miles.

Day five. It’s cloudier and more blustery.
Whisper uses her navigation and cartography skills … but the party goes in a circle. We made 12 miles, so 96 miles total.

Day six. Same weather.

Elara whips out her drum and plays inspiring marching music.
We are amazed at how well we keep rhythm, almost looks like a music video. We made 24 miles, so 120 miles total.

Day seven.

Doctor Pepe scouts ahead and picks a good path early in the day. On our left, we see a bright orange ribbon through the snow. Lava river. We have to skirt it. We made 12 miles, so 132 miles total.
Towards dusk, we see a griffin. It appears to be using its beak to bite at its wing.

Scarlet casts speak with animals. There’s an arrow in its wing.
She asks if it is hurt, and can we help?
The griffin invites her to help.
She uses her medicine skills to remove the arrow.
She then heals the griffin’s wound completely.
It lowers itself down offering a ride, and Scarlet climbs on.
She scouts for us.
The griffin warns about giants far north.

Day eight.
Winds cut our visibility, but with the griffin we still make 24 miles, total 156 miles.

Day nine.
Bad weather. But we get 24 miles for a total of 180 miles.
The griffin leaves.
As we start setting up camp, Halite notices a 3' tall egg.
White alabaster.
Kragor licks the egg and takes 2 points of cold damage.
This is certainly a white dragon egg.
It’s far along in its gestation period (which is usually about 90 days).
I decide to take it with us.

Day 10. Clear day.
We use Sparky as a lookout.
Towards the end of the day, Doctor Pepe spots a lone figure walking in an unusually straight line. Somewhat in our direction. It’s route will intersect the river.
While most of the party moves to avoid the figure,
Doctor Pepe sneaks for a better look.
As the creature comes within 100' of the party, it starts toward us.

Kragor casts Armor of Agathys in preparation.

The creature goes towards Scarlet and stops 20' away.
It asks “Where is Lucien?”
Kragor and Elara walks up to help in the conversation (bardic inspiration). Scarlet points to Balenpost and lies,
“I think you can find him at Balenpost, over there.”
It very single-mindly follows her direction.

24 miles covered. Total 204 miles.

Day 11.

Whisper and Elara team up on their navigation skills.
Doctor Pepe notices three ice mephits 200–300' away.
It must be the entrance to Salsvalt.

We engage. They are about 60ft away.

Scarlet casts entangle on them. Two of them become entangled.

Halite closes half the space to the mephits, and throws his javelin at the one that did not become entangled. Hits for 11 damage. Doctor Pepe advances to bring the same mephit within range. He shoots him for 8 damage. The mephit is having trouble staying in the air. Elara shoots her bow for 8 damage. The mephit explodes, shards of ice all over.

Whisper dashes up to an entangled mephit and ties it up.
Kragor hexes the other one, and fires and eldritch blast that wildly misses. Gerhard casts hunter’s mark on it, and shoots it with his bow for 14 damage.

The tied mephit breathes an ice blast at Whisper for 3 points of cold damage. A fog cloud descends on the area.

Halite throws the javelin through the fog, killing the mephit Gerhard had hit. There is a pop, and then the fog cloud clears.

Doctor Pepe fires his crossbow (critical) hitting for 12 damage.

Elara shoots her bow for 5 damage. The mephit looks pretty sad.
Whisper attempts to knock it out with a Flurry of Blows (she missed her normal attack lol), 5 damage, inadvertently taking off its head. The mephit explodes hitting Whisper for 3 points of cold damage.

We see a sloped building behind some doors. It is starting to slip underwater.
