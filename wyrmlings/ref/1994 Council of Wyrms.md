# Council of Wyrms (1994)

> Bill Slavicsek, _Council of Wyrms_ (Lake Geneva, WI: TSR, 1994).

Dragons instinctively know a select number of combat and noncombat proficiencies upon hatching. as per the rules in Book One. Dragons learn some of these proficiencies subliminally as they grow within their eggs. They learn the modern-languages proficiency, for example, by listening to the sounds of dragon speech that filter in through their shells.

The same applies to a hatchling’s name. Upon emerging from its egg, a dragon knows its name and clan affiliation. How? When a female dragon lays a n egg, she instinctively knows the nature of the hatchling growing within it. The _draca_, or dragon mother, spends the first several days after laying a clutch of eggs whispering an identifying phrase over and over to each egg in turn. “You are Agoron of Clan Cloudwalker,” a silver _draca_ might say, murmuring the phrase until it echoes within the unborn dragon’s shell. The _draca_ will repeat each egg’s phrase until the baby dragon has imprinted on the words.
