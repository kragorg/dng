# The Tutoring Plan {#main .plain}

**Goal:** Using magically enhanced techniques of [Total Physical Response](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_physical_response), Kragor will teach the wyrmling Orcish and learn Draconic in return.

Kragor will act as the tutor for the wyrmling, and the wyrmling will act as the tutor for Kragor. Since we don’t share a common language yet, Kragor will use his spellcasting to bridge the gap:

- [**Comprehend Languages**](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618993-comprehend-languages): Kragor will has leased Doctor Pepe’s [_Ring of Comprehension_](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9826437-ring-of-comprehension) for a year. He will carefully it to have one hour a day to understand the wyrmling’s feedback, questions, and definitions.

- [**Silent Image**](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619062-silent-image): Through the _Misty Visions_ invocation, Kragor will create perfect, 3D images of objects (a sword, a treasure chest, a remorhaz) while speaking the Orcish word. The wyrmling repeats it, then gives Kragor the Draconic word—which he understands through _Comprehend Languages_. By animating the image, actions too can be demonstrated.

- [**Minor Illusion**](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619039-minor-illusion): The cantrip can be used to add sounds to _Silent Image_, enhancing the lesson.

This’ll require focusing Kragor’s 3rd level build primarily on the above.

According to the “Training” rules, learning a language takes time (standard is ~250 days) and usually costs gold (1 gp/day for an instructor). Kragor will spend the required downtime days. The wyrmling is not charging Kragor tuition, although Kragor is still providing for its needs and helping it seed a hoard.
