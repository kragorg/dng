## Encounters in Eiselcross

The characters find a 3-foot-tall, 50-pound egg. If they keep the egg in a cold environment for 1d10 weeks, a white dragon wyrmling hatches from it.

## Islands of Eiselcross

**Beissel.** Eiselcross’s third largest island is so far north that even prepared explorers have trouble surviving the cold. Most don’t dare brave an expedition, and those who do turn back once they see the white dragons that rule Beissel.
