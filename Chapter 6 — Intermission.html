<h1 id="intermission">Intermission</h1>
<p><span class="dropcap">The yurt’s interior glows with</span> a warm,
flickering light from the central fire pit, a defiant warmth against the
relentless Syrinlya wind that howls outside like a wounded beast. Doctor
Pepe is the first to notice a message from Captain Stonebeard left on
the yurt’s only table: the Remorhaz requires weeks of repair before it
might be able to make another crossing of the Frigid Depths. The clock
ticks mercilessly for the Liel-Tethwick family, with Salsvault 200 miles
away and the Frigid Woe’s icy grip threatening to claim their lives. It
had already been five days since they had left Palebank Village, and the
adventurers knew that they must set out immediately.</p>
<p>Elara, her celestial nature radiating with optimism, sets about
lifting their spirits. Her hand drum sets a vibrant rhythm, a defiant
heartbeat against the wind’s relentless howl. Her eyes gleam with an
almost manic energy as she launches into a quick, lively beat.</p>
<p>Gerhard sits hunched, a man broken by loss. The <em>Frostfang</em>,
his life’s work, now exists only in memory. Rorik’s placement aboard the
Remorhaz feels like salt in an open wound. “What’s-his-name is dead to
me,” he mutters, his voice cracking with unshed grief, whisky sloshing
in a trembling hand.</p>
<p>Scarlet moves closer, her presence as grounding as the earth itself.
“Even after the fiercest blizzard, the smallest shoot can still find the
sun. Even when the great beasts tear through the forest, life finds a
way to grow back, sometimes stronger, sometimes in a new and unexpected
form,” she says to Gerhard. “You’ve lost much, yes, but you’re still
here. And your skills, your knowledge of this unforgiving land… they’re
not lost. They’re waiting. Our quest isn’t just for some glittering
bauble, though treasure does have its uses. We’re seeking a cure, a way
to mend what’s broken in the world, much like you might one day find a
way to mend the loss within you.”</p>
<p>Her words are a balm, cutting through Gerhard’s fog of despair. He
looks up, really sees the faces around him for the first time. Something
shifts in his eyes— a spark of possibility rekindling. Finally, he lets
out a shaky sigh. “Well, what the hell. There’s really nothing I can do,
stranded here with no boat and no crew. I might as well go with you lot.
May I find a fortune while keeping you out of trouble.”</p>
<p>Halite claps him on the back, the impact nearly knocking Gerhard off
balance. “Welcome aboard,” he rumbles with a genuine smile. Whisper
offers a small, encouraging nod. The others add words of encouragement
as well, all of them welcoming the skills Gerhard brings to the
team.</p>
<p>Elara, sensing the shift in mood, launches into a rambunctious
rendition of “A Troll’s Grin and a Fairy’s Hand,” her hand drum
accompanying her voice as she celebrates their new collaboration. Her
lilting song fills the yurt, promising adventure and companionship,
drowning out the wind’s mournful song.</p>
<h2 id="kragor-speaks-up">Kragor speaks up</h2>
<p>Kragor has remained uncharacteristically silent, lost in thought.
Subdued. But as Elara’s last note fades, he abruptly stands. He draws a
deep breath, his chest visibly expanding.</p>
<p>“Alright. Listen up. I got something to say,” he begins, his voice
raw, almost hesitant. He begins the story of his initiation into the
arcane, and as the party leans in, the walls of the yurt seem to melt
away, replaced by the cold, dark streets of Bladegarden.</p>
<p>“I’ve made it no secret that I get my magic from … somewhere from
without our realm. But I never told you how, or why I came here. To the
north. My business is my own. Yet now… things are getting weird. Bad
weird. And I fear keeping secrets too close might bring you to your
doom. And then I die too, ’cause we’re stuck together now.”</p>
<p>He stares beyond the yurt’s walls, his eyes unfocused, lost in a
memory that transcends time and space. He shares the story of the past,
and, as he does, his listeners are able to see the world in the same
bleak way that he does.</p>
<p>“My journey began after many, many moons of strange sleep as I lived
on the streets of Bladegarden. Hearing whispers. Bad dreams full of dark
shapes that called my name. Visions of stars falling, and huge dark
shapes just beyond reach. And something there, watching. Always
watching.” He pauses, as if trying to grasp the memories. “Then, on a
very dark night, some man-whelps tried to kill me. But I refused to die
like a nobody. Just another forgotten orc, fatherless trash. I was
scared and nearly dead. So I yelled into darkness… I gave up to…
whatever the watcher was.”</p>
<p>His eyes blaze with an inner fire as he describes the moment of
transformation. “Then I felt it!” he says. “Cold like night but… nice.
It wrapped around me like black smoke. It whispered secrets in a strange
tongue I do not know. Then, power filled me! A war hammer appeared in my
fist from nowhere. I felt no remorse when I smashed in my attacker’s
stupid face right then and there, then blasted the other scum with dark
crackling magic that sent them running like scared rabbits.”</p>
<p>Whisper glances at Halite, a silent question in her eyes: “Where is
this going?”</p>
<p>Kragor’s eyes harden as he adds, “But I know such magic comes at a
cost. The dreams kept coming, mostly nonsensical. Gradually, they formed
some thought— a command and a promise for greater power. ‘Go north.
Cross the frozen north. To Eiselcross.’ Don’t know why exactly. Maybe to
find something. Maybe to smash something.</p>
<p>“But comrades… I’ve new dreams now. Worse dreams. More than dreams.”
The orc shifts uneasily from one foot to another, a gesture of worry
that his companions are not used to seeing. “Back at that tavern, the
Jolly Dwarf, some night I slept bad. Couldn’t remember what I dreamed,
but when I woke up… my fingers had dirt under the nails. Broken nails.
It made no senses! I am clean … fastidious! And then on the Remorhaz,
while crossing the ice sea, I woke up in the night. But I was not in my
bed! I was… somewhere else. Couldn’t move. Felt like mountains of ice
pressing down on me. Hearing ice cracking. For a long time, I couldn’t
even feel myself breathing. Couldn’t scream. This was no dream. It felt
like I was locked away, buried under ice. Then, snap! Back in my bunk.
And again, dirt under my nails! Dirt that should not be there… could not
be there!”</p>
<p>Kragor shudders, a chill running down his spine that has nothing to
do with the icy wind. “Whatever got its claws in me… it’s doing
something with my body when I’m sleeping. And that ain’t good for any of
us.”</p>
<p>As Kragor’s story ends, a stillness falls over the yurt as the
companions ponder the implications.</p>
<p>Elara is the first to break the silence, her voice soft but resolute.
“We should stay close,” she says, looking directly at Kragor. “I’ll bunk
near you, keep watch. Maybe we can understand what’s happening.”</p>
<p>Whisper’s tail twitches nervously. “Tie him up?” she suggests, her
feline eyes narrowing.</p>
<p>“No,” Halite rumbles, shaking his head. “We may need Kragor’s powers
if we encounter trouble. Restraints could slow us down.”</p>
<p>Doctor Pepe leans forward, stroking his chin. “Interesting
predicament. Sounds like a magical possession, or perhaps something more
sinister.”</p>
<p>Scarlet closes her eyes, communing silently with the natural energies
around them. “There’s something… off. A presence. But I can’t quite
identify it.”</p>
<p>As the discussion continues, Elara retrieves her harp. Her fingers
dance across the strings, weaving a gentle lullaby that seems to soften
the harsh edges of their conversation. The melody speaks of protection,
of peaceful rest, of guardianship against unknown threats.</p>
<p>Gerhard, still haunted but feeling more connected to the group,
volunteers for first watch. The night passes quietly, save for the
discovery that someone in the group snores with the thunderous intensity
of a winter storm.</p>
<p>Halite takes the second watch. The camp remains still, with
occasional sounds of people moving to relieve themselves against the
bitter cold. The wind whispers secrets outside, but nothing disturbs
their rest.</p>
<p>Elara’s watch is marked by intense focus. Her eyes never leave
Kragor, watching for any sign of movement, any hint of the strange
nocturnal activity he described. But the orc remains motionless, his
breathing steady and deep.</p>
<p>As Scarlet takes the final watch, the first hints of dawn begin to
paint the sky. The sounds of the camp slowly come to life— the rustling
of sleeping bags, the soft clanking of cooking utensils, the preparatory
movements of travelers readying for a day’s journey.</p>
<p>Morning arrives, and Kragor’s nails are clean. No mud, no dirt—
nothing to suggest mysterious events.</p>
<h2 id="the-journey-begins">The Journey Begins</h2>
<p>The party decides on a measured pace, hoping to cover approximately
24 miles each day without undue risk. Gerhard, drawing on years of
wilderness experience, prepares their rations. His hands move with
practiced efficiency,</p>
<p>Scarlet sends Sparky, her faithful owl companion, to scout ahead. But
the bird, more accustomed to wooded landscapes, seems perplexed by the
endless expanse of snow. There are no trees, no rocks— just an infinite
white canvas stretching to the horizon.</p>
<p>As night falls, they make camp beneath a half-moon of Catha, the Moon
Weaver. Ruidus, the small moon, hangs full— a celestial harbinger of ill
tidings that sends a collective shiver through the group.</p>
<p>During Whisper’s watch, a bright light streaks across the sky from
east to west. She makes note of it but waits until morning to mention
the anomaly.</p>
<p>The second day out from Syrinlya brings challenges. A steep cliff
face looms before them, its icy surface treacherous and unforgiving.
Halite steps forward, his massive frame a testament to strength and
determination as he swings the grappling hook up and over the edge of
the cliff. With the grappling hook secured, he scales the cliff with
surprising grace, creating a lifeline for his companions. One by one,
they traverse the obstacle, each movement calculated and precise.</p>
<p>As evening approaches, clouds gather, muting the landscape into
shades of gray and white. The cold is relentless, but they sleep
soundly— except for one.</p>
<p>During her watch, Elara notices Kragor’s restlessness. He curls into
a tight ball, his massive frame seeming to shrink. Unable to wake him,
she watches him intentently as he oscillates between struggle and
paralysis. When morning finally comes, his fingernails are once again
caked with mud— impossible in this frozen wasteland of ice and snow.</p>
<p>On the third day, as they trudge forward, the monotonous white
landscape is interrupted by two rock formations, standing like silent
sentinels approximately ten feet tall. Their sudden appearance is both a
relief and a source of renewed tension, breaking the endless white with
their dark, weathered surfaces.</p>
<p>Something is watching. Something is waiting.</p>
