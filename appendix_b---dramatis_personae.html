<h1 id="appendix-b-dramatis-personae">Appendix B — Dramatis
Personae</h1>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Adventurers</strong>: The primary group consisting of
<strong>Elara</strong>, <strong>Halite</strong>,
<strong>Kragor</strong>, <strong>Scarlet</strong>,
<strong>Whisper</strong>, <strong>Doctor Pepe</strong>, and— more
recently— <strong>Gerhard</strong>. Brought together by the shared quest
to unravel the mystery of the Frigid Woe, they have journeyed from
Palebank Village to the icy shores of Eiselcross aboard the
<em>Remorhaz</em>, and are now trekking across Foren to the Salsvault
ruins. Each member is undergoing personal growth, honing their unique
skills and deepening their bonds through shared adversity, unexpected
moments of camaraderie (and cooking lessons), and the unsettling
revelation of Kragor’s mysterious nocturnal experiences.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Arl Bortock</strong>: A jovial dwarf who tends bar at the
<em>Jolly Dwarf</em> in Palebank Village. He provides the adventurers
with lodging, refreshments, local insights, and identifies the
Liel-Tethwick family. He later promises a thorough cleaning of his inn
upon learning of potential contamination.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Bandits (Croaker Cave)</strong>: Followers of Hulil
Lutan, tasked with defending her operations within Croaker Cave. They
battled the adventurers, resulting in casualties and one captured dwarf
(associated with the Uttolot family) who provided intelligence before
being knocked out.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Bandits (Pelc’s Curiosities)</strong>: Followers of Hulil
Lutan, encountered ransacking the shop searching for clues to cure
Hulil’s Frigid Woe. They engaged the adventurers in combat but
surrendered after several were defeated, revealing Hulil’s location and
affliction.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Bill</strong>: A Glassblade in Palebank Village,
encountered at the <em>Jolly Dwarf</em>, providing warnings about the
dangers of the Frigid Woe and the port closure.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Bret</strong>: A human wizard and member of the Cerberus
Assembly, rescued by the <em>Remorhaz</em> after the <em>Frostfang</em>,
on which he had purchased passage, was destroyed by a giant squid. He
was traveling as a passenger under Captain Gerhard Eisner and seeks
urgent passage to Icehaven in Eiselcross, carrying vital news about
Aeorian constructs encountered in the wastes. Captain Stonebeard has
denied his request for diversion, directing him to Palebank
Village.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Buyer</strong>: An enigmatic figure residing in a
large, well-maintained yurt in Syrinlya. Elro has instructed the party
to deliver the Frigid Woe cure to this individual for teleportation back
to Palebank Village. Orvo Mustave sold his share of the Salsvault
artifacts to this person.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Doctor Pepe</strong>: Initially a mysterious rogue
observing the adventurers, he formally joined their quest at Croaker
Cave. He contributes sharp investigative skills, stealth, crossbow
proficiency, and lock-picking abilities. He is proving adept at fishing
and cooking, receiving special utensils from Chef Ingrid, and has shown
skill at cards. He also discovered the properties of a garnet, showed
keen intuition for optimal paths during travel, and expressed a concern
for gluten-free scones.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Elara</strong>: An aasimar bard whose musical talents and
spellcasting bolster the party. She excels at negotiation, inspiration,
healing, and illusions. She discovered the Scanlan Shorthalt shirt,
negotiated potion prices with Gramini, interrogated bandits, attempted
diplomacy with Hulil, fed Old Croaker, identified Irven Liel, interacted
with Javel over <em>Tusk Love</em> (ch. 3 and 8), performed enchantingly
aboard the <em>Remorhaz</em>, played cards skillfully, and subdued the
wolf-form Ingrid with the amulet. She used <em>Light</em> to light
Doctor Pepe’s dagger, and <em>Speak with Animals</em> in an attempt to
calm the winter wolf. She is mastering new melodies and enchantments,
enhancing her performance and persuasion, and has taken on a guardian
role, watching over Kragor during his unsettling sleep. She fell asleep
briefly during her watch after the squid attack.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Elf Acolyte (Croaker Cave)</strong>: A male elf and
devout follower of Hulil Lutan, discovered kneeling beside her before a
tapestry of Tiamat. He engaged the party in combat in defense of his
priestess but was swiftly killed by a crossbow bolt to the neck from
Doctor Pepe.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Elro Aldataur</strong>: A Glassblade leader in Palebank
Village. He introduces the adventurers to the Frigid Woe mystery,
confirms the disease’s name and Aeorian origins, explains the cure
(milky liquid in golden vials), hires the party to retrieve the cure
from Eiselcross, provides payment and bounty for Hulil’s gang, arranges
passage on the <em>Remorhaz</em>, and identifies Orvo Mustave and “The
Buyer” as contacts in Syrinlya. He has also promised to ensure Irven
Liel’s family is cared for.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Fenton Tethwick</strong>: Irven Liel’s husband, traveling
with Irven and their twin tiefling daughters (Honor &amp; Magic). He
helps care for the children while Irven discusses sensitive matters with
the adventurers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Gerhard Eisner</strong>: The former captain of the
<em>Frostfang</em>, rescued alongside his crewman Rorik and passenger
Bret. Hails from Icehaven, from a family of fishermen who recently began
ferrying passengers. He possesses a magical ring allowing him to walk on
water. Deeply affected by the loss of his ship, he has decided to join
the adventurers’ quest, contributing his wilderness experience,
map-reading skills, and combat support. He carries ship insurance
procured from an Empire contact and takes turns on watch.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Giant Ice Frogs (Croaker Cave)</strong>: Two aggressive,
mastiff-sized, blue-skinned frogs that served as guards in the first
chamber of Croaker Cave. They ambushed Doctor Pepe and Whisper upon
their entry, wounding Whisper before the rest of the party arrived. One
was killed by Elara’s magic, and the other retreated after being wounded
by Doctor Pepe. They are distinct from the much larger,
semi-domesticated Old Croaker.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Giant Squid</strong>: A colossal cephalopod encountered
in the fog-laden Frigid Depths. It destroyed the <em>Frostfang</em> and
attacked the <em>Remorhaz</em> before being slain by the combined
efforts of the adventurers and crew. Sparky reported its remains smelled
like farts.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Gramini</strong>: An elderly elf potion vendor at the
Palebank Village docks. She sells the party healing potions, trades for
a Scanlan Shorthalt shirt (which she frames and prices highly), and
offers initial advice about Westeroff.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Griffin</strong>: A magnificent but unnamed griffin
encountered with an arrow lodged in its wing. After Scarlet communicated
with, treated, and healed the beast, it showed its gratitude by allowing
her to ride it for several days. It served as an aerial scout for the
party during their trek across Foren and warned them of giants to the
north before departing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Haldor</strong>: A deck hand on the <em>Remorhaz</em>,
born and raised in snowy lands but with a love for fishing. He confronts
the winter wolf in the kitchen with Ironfist and later bonds with
Whisper while working the rigging, sharing stories of their respective
homes and showing her techniques for tackling ice frozen into
ropes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Halite</strong>: A goliath fighter known for his
strength, tactical mind, and mastery of the trident and javelin. He
actively participates in interrogations and combat strategy. He has
discovered a surprising aptitude and interest in cooking under Chef
Ingrid’s tutelage, receiving special utensils and viewing cooking as a
form of strategic battle planning. He acquired an arcane crystal focus
from Westeroff and a miner’s pick in Syrinlya. He delivered the killing
blow to both the Giant Squid and the Young Remorhaz, and nearly got
buried in a snow pit. He harbors an ambition to learn more than just the
cure and seeks to bring lost knowledge back to his people.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hulil Lutan</strong>: A dwarf priestess of Tiamat and
sister of Tulgi. Afflicted with Frigid Woe, she led criminal operations
from Croaker Cave, seeking Aeorian artifacts and a cure. Defeated by the
party, her journal revealed the sale of a blue vial to Irven
Liel.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ice Mephits</strong>: Three small, malevolent elemental
creatures of ice, described as “flickering motes of azure” and “shards
of living ice.” They are drawn to the magic sustaining the Salsvault
ruins. Agile fliers, they attack with blasts of frigid air and can
exhale shrouds of dense, swirling fog. They are fragile, exploding into
ice shards when defeated by the party.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ingrid</strong>: The skilled, if gruff, dwarven chef
aboard the <em>Remorhaz</em>. She is revealed to be a lycanthrope
(winter wolf), her transformation tied to a moon-and-rune amulet. She
mentors several party members in cooking, gifting utensils to Kragor,
Halite, and Doctor Pepe in recognition of their talent. She apologized
to Whisper for biting her while transformed, and incongruously offered
sandwiches during the height of the giant squid battle.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ironfist</strong>: The First Mate of the
<em>Remorhaz</em>. He confronts the winter wolf in the kitchen with
Haldor and participates actively in the battle against the giant squid,
manning a ballista and attempting to throw a rescue rope to the
water-walking survivor.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Irven Liel</strong>: A traveling bookseller (specializing
in wholesale) heading to Uthodurn with his husband Fenton and their twin
tiefling daughters. He purchased a cracked blue vial containing Frigid
Woe contagion from Hulil Lutan as an investment. He cooperates with the
party, allowing Scarlet to confirm the danger, and now relies on them
finding the cure for him and his entire family. He is a proponent of
“Feather Leather” as a best-selling book.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Javel</strong>: An ancient, coughing dwarf trader
operating out of a yurt in Syrinlya. He sells the party snowshoes
(including blood-stained ones from a halfling eaten by a yeti) and ice
hammers, bonding with Elara over a shared appreciation for the novel
<em>Tusk Love</em> and gifting her a bottle of Sandkeg’s High whiskey.
He warns them about yetis.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Kragor</strong>: An orc warlock from Bladegarden wielding
eldritch power and a conjured war hammer. He actively uses hexes and
blasts in combat, interrogates prisoners, and provides tactical
spellcasting. He has discovered a talent for cooking under Chef Ingrid’s
tutelage, receiving special utensils. He questioned Bret about his
mission and Ingrid about her amulet. His arcane abilities are growing,
allowing him to recover energy and enhance his eldritch blasts. He
revealed his origin story, stating he gained his power from an
otherworldly patron after experiencing strange dreams and near-death in
Bladegarden. He has since been tormented by recurring nightmares of
being entombed under ice, waking with inexplicable dirt under his
fingernails. He discovered an “orphan” white dragon egg, felt a deep,
personal connection to it, and despite its dangers, adopted it as his
own, licking it in a moment of madness and injuring his tongue.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Liel-Tethwicks</strong>: The traveling family
consisting of Irven Liel, his husband Fenton Tethwick, and their twin
tiefling daughters, Honor and Magic. They become entangled in the Frigid
Woe mystery due to Irven’s purchase of a contaminated vial.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mathias</strong>: The harried elf proprietor of
“Mathias’s Stuffs” in Palebank Village, where the party buys supplies
and sells bandit gear. He provides a warning about violent “wild folk”
with black streaks on their faces in Eiselcross.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mera</strong>: The skilled navigator of the
<em>Remorhaz</em>. She participates in the card game, expertly pilots
the ship through fog and during the squid attack, and calculates their
position and arrival time in Syrinlya. She expressed delight at Elara’s
musical performance and the liveliness of the group.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Morgo Delwur</strong>: A stout, weathered dwarf woman
acting as an informal guide or contact in Syrinlya. She directs the
party to Orvo and The Buyer, offers them the yurt of a deceased elf
lordling (eaten by a saber-toothed tiger), and mentions local dangers
before heading off on her own expedition.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Old Croaker</strong>: A giant ice frog of unusual size
dwelling in Croaker Cave. Used by Hulil’s bandits (and later the party)
for transport across an underground pool, motivated by treats (bats, elf
hands). It attacked Whisper when startled. Scarlet confirmed it is
venomous.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Orvo Mustave</strong>: A dwarf adventurer in Syrinlya and
friend of the deceased Urgon, identified by a distinctive three-line
scar on his cheek. He accompanied Urgon on the expedition where the blue
vials were found in the Salsvault ruins (located in the Thin Sheets
region). He provides the party with directions, details about the ruins’
dangers (Ice Mephits, animated armor), confirms he sold his share of
artifacts to The Buyer, and directs them to Javel for snowshoes. He is
saddened and angered by Urgon’s death.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rorik</strong>: A young human crewman from the
<em>Frostfang</em>, rescued alongside Captain Gerhard Eisner and Bret.
He seems loyal to Gerhard.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scanlan Shorthalt</strong>: A legendary and widely
popular bard, known through his merchandise and literary works rather
than a personal appearance. His name appears on a rare shirt the party
barters to Gramini for a discount, and his book, <em>Adventure Sexy:
Impress Potential Lovers with Great Deeds</em>, is found in an abandoned
yurt in Syrinlya.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scarlet</strong>: A halfling druid deeply connected to
nature. She uses her knowledge, healing magic, and combat spells to aid
the party. She identified Verla Pelc’s cause of death, tested the blue
vial for contagion, identified Old Croaker’s venom, and diagnosed
Ingrid’s lycanthropy. She has gained an owl companion (“Sparky”) used
for scouting and has shown skill with the ballista. She acquired
blood-stained snowshoes from Javel that were stained with blood from a
halfling killed by a yeti. She is embracing the forms of earthly
creatures and experienced a “flumph fever dream.” She used <em>Fog
Cloud</em> to create a diversion and <em>Entanglement</em> to ensnare
mephits. She communicated with and healed a griffin, riding it to scout
ahead and receiving a warning about towering giants to the north. She
sustained a burn extracting fire-resistant scales from the Young
Remorhaz’s carcass.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sparky</strong>: Scarlet’s owl familiar. A loyal and
effective scout, Sparky provides aerial reconnaissance for the party. He
scouted the fog-laden sea for land, reporting back to Scarlet that the
remains of the giant squid “smelled bad… like farts.” He also proves
helpful with navigating the featureless terrain of Foren.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Stonebeard</strong>: The seasoned captain of the
<em>Remorhaz</em>. Initially deferential to Elro, he reveals a
pragmatic, no-nonsense command style once at sea. He oversees ship
operations, directs the crew during crises (the lycanthropy incident and
the squid attack), interacts with the rescued survivors, and safely
navigates to Syrinlya. He was surprised to learn of Ingrid’s
lycanthropy, declined to charge Gerhard passage, and discussed the
squid’s unusual focus on Bret. His ship requires weeks of repair before
another crossing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tulgi Lutan</strong>: A solitary trapper in Palebank
Village and sister of Hulil. Afflicted with Frigid Woe, she confessed
her and Hulil’s criminal activities and theft from Urgon, revealing
Hulil’s location in Croaker Cave.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Undead Figure</strong>: A solitary, decaying humanoid
figure encountered walking with unnerving precision across the frozen
landscape of Foren. The sound of its voice is like “grinding stone,” and
it appears to be sightless. It is driven by a singular, obsessive
purpose, asking, “Where is Lucien?” The party redirected it towards the
River Inferno, hoping it would incinerate itself. Scarlet identified it
as undead.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Urgon Wenth</strong>: A dwarven adventurer whose return
from Eiselcross afflicted with Frigid Woe and subsequent death sparked
the story’s central mystery. He recovered Aeorian artifacts, including
the blue vials containing the contagion, from the Salsvault ruins
alongside Orvo Mustave.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Verla Pelc</strong>: The owner of Pelc’s Curiosities in
Palebank Village. Found frozen dead in her shop by the adventurers, a
victim of the Frigid Woe after purchasing the blue vials from Urgon and
handling them.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Westeroff</strong>: A retired wizard in Palebank Village.
He provides limited magical identification services, confirms Urgon’s
dagger is magical, sells Halite a crystal focus, and identifies a garnet
for Doctor Pepe. He is notably not a fan of music.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Whisper</strong>: A tabaxi monk known for exceptional
agility, stealth, and scouting. She often takes point, gathers
information, and utilizes her claws and thrown weapons in combat. She
survived being partially swallowed by an ice frog and later bitten by
Ingrid in wolf form. She has enhanced resilience and self-healing
capabilities. She worked the rigging aboard the <em>Remorhaz</em>,
bonded with Haldor over stories of their homes and ice-tackling
techniques, and excelled in the squid battle. She repeatedly expresses
her dislike for Old Croaker, muttering “fucking frog.” She leads
scouting missions, can have difficulty navigating featureless terrain,
and noted a bright light streak across the sky during her watch. She
attempted to bind an ice mephit and inadvertently took its head
off.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>White Dragon Egg</strong>: A massive, three-foot-tall,
alabaster-white egg discovered by Halite on the Foren plains. Radiating
an intense cold, it was identified by Scarlet as a white dragon egg that
is perilously close to hatching. Kragor, after injuring his tongue by
licking its frozen surface, formed an intense, personal connection to
the egg, declaring it an “orphan” like himself and adopting it as his
own, much to the concern of his companions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Young Remorhaz</strong>: A monstrous, heat-radiating,
segmented worm native to Eiselcross, capable of burrowing through snow
and ice. The party encountered and defeated a juvenile remorhaz,
confirming its aggressive, predatory nature and its unique internal
furnace that consumes objects on contact. Its iridescent scales (thrym)
offer fire resistance.</p></li>
