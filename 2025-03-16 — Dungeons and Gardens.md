# To the cave

The party goes to back to the tavern “Jolly Dwarf”. We use our two rooms and wake up at 7:30 the next morning.

Cold spring weather.

The inn is not at all busy because the port is closed. There’s just a family: two men, and a couple of young tiefling girls. One of them had a book bag. Normal clothes.

Halite questions Bortock. We ask about Croaker Cave. No one goes there. It is called that because you can hear giant ice frogs croaking. Folks know where it is, but don’t go there.

Bortock says Elro would come round soon. He was looking for us last night.

Kragor spends 5sp out of party inventory for house breakfast.

Kragor asks but Bortock didn’t know about Hulil. Shady Creek Run families are not popular around here.

Kragor asks about healing potions. Bortock knows about a shack by the docks. Gramini. An older elf wise woman sells stuff.

As we finish our meals, Elro shows up and asks how we’re doing, what did we find out. Head of guards.

Scarlet fills Elro in. We explained Tulgi and Hulil and Verla. Elro hadn’t known about Hulil. But Erlo has long suspected they were involved with folk in Shady Creek Run family. We don’t like those folk.

Croaker’s Cave? Whisper asks why it is dangerous there. Giant ice frogs. Scarlet asks how big they are. About the size of a large wolf.
Scarlet knows of these creatures, or at least giant frogs. Not venomous. They can swallow and have burning stomach acid. Smarter than regular frogs but not smart. A teacher kept one as a pet.

Whisper asks if there are other creatures in the cave. Elro says no one goes there, so shrug.
But please help us root out these Shady Creek folk.

Elro will send some folks to clean up at Pelc’s.

(It took about 60 days for Urgon and Verla each to die from the affliction. We know Verla met Urgon two months ago from the receipt.Tulgi probably doesn’t have long.)

## Gramini

The party goes to the docks to find Gramini. There are a lot of shacks. The one we were directed to is the definition of a “shanty”.Sign “Goods for Sale” super generic.

We stand outside the shack and elect Elara to negotiate. Halite opens the door and a bell rings.
In the dark room, we see a bunch of junk, and pops up an elf with a blue scarf tied over head and around her chin.
Coat on. A little fire behind the counter.

Elara asks about potions.
Oh, is this about Urgon? I don’t have a potion that could treat his ailments.
I do have a few basics, they go very quickly as people go to Eiselcross.
She has four health potions. 60gp each, but can discount to 50gp. Elara asks for a lower cost, and tho she can’t get that low. But ok I like you 48gp.

Elara asks for rumors. They closed the port! Gramini feels it is sure this disease is from Aeor.

We offer bartering. Kragor asks if she knows Scanlan Shorthalt. She is interested in the Shorthalt shirt. and will trade for 15gp.
We offer to fit it, but she wants to do it herself.
Scanlan was so charming.
She puts on the T-shirt and is prancing like a teenager.
You made my week.

We collected funds from the charactes: 65 gp from Krago, 22 gp from ?, 9 gp from ?, 14 gp from ?
The party buys two of the potions for a total of 81gp.
The party currency is now 29gp.

## Croaker Cave

The rogue is already at the cave entrance and notices the party coming. He approaches us and says “don’t hurt me! I have something you need to know!”

Scarlet and Whisper sees the rogue coming out of the woods. Whisper recognizes him. Non-threatening approach.
The party interrogates: who are you and what do you want?
Not part of those bandits! I was also investigating the disease.

Dr. Pepe says he saw three cloaked figure go into the cave just before daybreak. He thinks a dwarf and two elves.
Dr. Pepe joins us.

Elara knows that the entrance has many prints coming in and out.
Whisper and Dr. Pepe head into the cave entrance. Elara casts Light on Dr. Pepe’s spare dagger.
About 10' in they see a pool of water.
Whisper scans the area.
Ceilings are 10' high, but only about 8' of clearance because of stalactites.
Slow dripping of water falling from them into the murky pool.
Every few moments you hear a loud croaking sound.
Moving the light to the edge of the tool, very quietly Dr. Pepe peers into the darkness and sees the end of a beam of wood.

Whisper stubs her paw.
Two giant frogs jump out of the water.

One of them lunges to bite Dr. Pepe’s leg, but he is able to dodge it.
The blue frog is about the size of a mastiff.

The second frog lurches at Whisper.
It bites down hard and grapples her. She successfully breaks free a bit worse for wear. She scratches the frog across the face.

The rest of the party sees Whisper’s attack and prepare to engage.

Dr. Pepe and Whisper here boots on stone… someone is coming!

Dr. Pepe swings his shortsword at the wounded frog, lightly stabbing it. Then embeds his dagger into its head. The frog is visibly unhappy frog.

The frog in front of Dr. Pepe attacks him again, this time sinking its teeth into him and grappling him.

The injured frog in front Whisper attempts to slink back into the water. Whisper takes a swing but misses.

Whisper slashes at the remaining frog again, wounding it. Whisper disengages to leave the cave.

Halite sees that the rogue is in trouble. He runs in to attack the frog with his trident, striking true. The frog does not let go of Dr. Pepe.

Elara blasts the frog with starry wisp and in falls down into the water.

Kragor uses adrenaline rush to reposition himself, getting 2 temporary HP.

A bolt hits Dr. Pepe, nearly killing him.

A second bolt whistles past Halite’s open book. A third bolt strikes hard, but thanks to his Stone’s Endurance it is more of a glancing wound. He can see three figures attempting to shoot us.

Scarlet runs to Whisper’s side and casts cure wounds, completely restoring her.

Dr. Pepe takes a shot at one of the assailants and misses.

Whisper shoots her sling at the bandit nearest the board and hits her mark. The bandit goes “oof!”. She then uses her Feline Agility to skip back outside the cave. Halite throws a javelin at the same target, taking them out.

Elara considers jumping across the pool but it seems too far.
She fires a mote of light across the water.
It strikes the elf right directly in the chest with a radiant blow.

Kragor peers at the elf that was hit.
He hexes and hits him with Eldritch Blast, killing him. He slips into the water.

The dwarf yells “fuck”. And shoots at Elara. Out of the gloom, the crossbow bolt catches her in the thigh. Then the dwarf darts deeper into the cave.

Scarlet throws her grappling hook in an attempt to grab the beam, but misses. But as she starts pulling it back, it snags on something. She pulls as hard as she can, and hunkers down to hold the rope. She feels a jerk on the rope.

Whisper moves into the cave entrance and throws her torch across, but it falls short into the water. She retreats out of the cave entrance.

Halite moves to help Scarlet with the rope. He pulls it in slowly— it does jerk a few times. There seems to be a dim light at the end of the rope. Surprising, he pulls up a body and a frog.

Elara lays hands on herself to fully restore.

Kragor hexes the frog and pulverizes it.

The dwarf returns and shoots at Halite, bouncing off his armor.

Scarlet rushes to Dr. Pepe’s side and completely heals him.

Dr. Pepe wails his glowing dagger at where he thinks the beam is. It flies out of sight, and hears it striking wood (thanks to bardic inspiration). Now the party can see the far shore.

Whisper springs into action, attempting to scale the cave wall above the pool. She makes it to the other side, where she sees the enemy dwarf.

Halite throws the grappling hook with amazing accuracy and pulls the board across, then immediately charges across the board (25' or so), with Kragor rushing quickly behind.

The dwarf (visible only to Whisper) is surprised, and attempts to take a shot, but it misses across the wall.

Scarlet rushes across the board as well, and produces a flame in her hand so the more unfortunate party members can see.

Dr. Pepe recovers his dagger and follows the others.

Whisper rushes towards the dwarf and swings at it with her paw, but it is knocked away with the dwarf’s shield.

Halite follows Whisper, javelin in hand. He throws the javelin, skewering him. He falls to the grown, barely alive.

Elara leaps off the board around Kragor and close enough to see the surrendering dwarf.
Elara and Kragor attempt to intimidate the dwarf, but he just doesn’t respond. “when a lady speaks, you listen”

Halite asks him “What family are you with?” “The Uttolot family.” “What are you doing in this cave?”
“I work here, for Hulil. We’re feeding them.”
“There is a lot more of us, but Hulil sent a bunch of us into town because she’s sick. She’s looking for a cure. They didn’t come back.”
He removes the javelin and starts to bandage his wound.

“Hulil will soon go to Shady Creek Run to sell the junk that Tulgi got. She wants a cure.”

Halite glowers at the dwarf.
“What else is in here?”
“A bunch of giant frogs. We were feeding them these bats, to train them to carry us across.”

Scarlet asks about the feeding. “They used to eat more people. But we keep them fed.”
Dr. Pepe notices the bucket of bats and picks them up.

Whisper says “Dwarf, tell me about traps that might be in here.” “There’s a bedroll covering a pit.” He points out the sleeping quarters.

Looting: crappy scimitars; one more light crossbow; 7 gp; 10sp.

The party ties dwarf’s hands and lead him through. Then they continue through the cavern, discovering the bed rolls and fire bit.

Dr. Pepe sees the bed roll stretched over a bit.

Whisper lights the fire with Druidcraft.

The party investigates the area, and finds an unopened bottle of Bald Dwarf whiskey. (Made by elves, approximately 25gp.)

The party splits to go down the two corridors. Halite and Dr. Pepe run into a swarm of bats. Halite stabs the air wildy with his trident, and strikes a stalagmite. The two of them run back up the corridor.

Kragor sees the big pool.
I demand that the dwarf tell us what is on the other side and how to get across.
Old Croaker ferries people across.

Then we see a huge (even for a giant frog) frog approaching.
Scarlet approaches him and she strokes her head.
Dr. Pepe throws him a treat.

Elara rides Old Croaker across the pool.
Once she’s at the edge, she sees two praying figures at an altar.
Tapestry with a dragon. A dwarf woman and male elf.
The fire in the middle of the cavern is huge.
The dwarf has the signs of the disease.
They both wear robes matching the tapestry.

Everybody crosses the pool except Whisper, who stays with the bound dwarf.

Scarlet recognizes the imagery on the tapestry.
Tiamat is the scaled tyrant, and the evil goddess of dragons.
Greed. Sworn enemy of the Platinum dragon.
One of the betrayer gods.

The two figures look up.
The dwarf (presumed Hulil) demands that we drop our weapons and explain ourselves.

Elara decides to say that the “dragons” sent us to understand the origin of this disease.
Hulil is having none of it, and becomes hostile.


Kragor hexes the elf, and attempts to hit them with a blast, but misses.
Scarlet casts shillelagh and runs to swing at the elf. She misses.
Dr. Pepe shoots the elf in the neck, downing him.

Halite throws his javelin at Hulil, stabbing her in the hip. She looks down at the javelin and commands him to flee in response, but it has no effect.

Hulil casts a spell causing a sword with a dragon claw pomel appear. It swings at Halite, missing.

Elara shoots her shortbow at Hulil, hitting her in the shoulder.

Kragor hexes Hulil, but misses hitting another stalagmite.

Whisper, hearing the commotion ahead, knocks out the dwarf.

Dr Pepe shoots. A solid hit. She’s heavily wounded. A second javelin from Halite misses.

Hulil reaches out a hand and summons a sickly green & jagged blade. She swings at Halite, but the blade bounces off his armor. She then pulls out a potion and quaffs it and immediately looks much better again.

Elara casts dissonant whispers which disrupts Hulil a bit.

Kragor hits Hulil with his Eldritch Blast.

Scarlet strikes with her quarterstaff, bludgeoning Hulil in her jaw. She’s starting to look angry and worn down.

Whisper attempts to scamper across the cave wall to join the party, but falls into the water. Old Croaker is startled by the splash, and snaps at Whisper, missing.
Whisper swims away from Old Croaker and starts climbing the wall again.

Dr. Pepe fires again, with a deadly hit.

Halite hears splashing back at the cavern. He doesn’t lose focus and stabs Hulil again. She falls unconscious.

Old Croaker leaps at Whisper, but cannot quite reach her.

Elara casts speak with animals, and tries to convince Old Croaker that if you take us back across we’ll give you more food.
But croaker wants this kitten sandwich.

Kragor hexes the frog, but again misses him.

Elara sighs, “Who needs enemies with friends like these.”

Whisper scrambles away into the main cavern and drops down to the floor. “Fucking frog! and no bats!”

Dr. Pepe shoots in the frog’s direction in the dark, but wildly misses.

Halite removes a hand from the elf.

Old Croaker lurches at Elara, attempting again to bite but misses.
Elara offers the frog the hand of the elf… it sits back and opens his mouth like a baby bird.
Halite tosses the hand into the frog. It sneaks back.

We look around the room and the bodies, but no keys.
8gp and 5sp.

Dr. Pepe examines the chest.
The lock is in the shape of a dragons head.
He sees that the lock has small pin holes with a little blue powder.
He attempts to disarm the trap.
He uses a leather cloth to cover his hand as he digs out the blue powder. There’s a lot, but he’s able to contain it in the skin.

Scarlet casts Detect Poison and Disease (as a ritual spell).
She detects magical contagion in the bag and in the chest, and she also senses the frog is poisonous/venomous.

With Scarlet’s help, Dr. Pepe proceeds to lockpick the chest and peeks inside. There is a gilded scroll case, a jade statuette of a storm giant, a quiver with six +1 arrows, a silver ring with jasper stone, 800–900 coins, an old notebook.

Dr. Pepe invites others to come over.

He removes all the goods and leaves the blue powder untouched.

- 415 cp
- 234 sp
- 43 ep
- 112 gp

The notebook is a journal. She sold a blue vial to Irven Liel.

We leave the cavern.
