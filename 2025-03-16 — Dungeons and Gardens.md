# Secrets of Croaker Cave

<span class="dropcap">The party retraces their steps</span> to the *Jolly Dwarf*, the village’s heart of warmth and camaraderie amid the chill. As the tavern door swings open, the familiarity of its cozy interior washes over them— flickering hearth light dances against the walls, and the low murmur of conversation mixes with the clinking of mugs. Unwinding from the day’s skirmishes, they retire to the modest comfort of their two rented rooms, voices still echoing with plans and reflections.

Morning creeps upon Palebank Village with a muted brilliance. Despite the season’s turn, the air is crisp and biting. The adventurers stir in their quarters at half-past seven,
while frost clings insistently to the glass panes. As the party readies themselves, the morning hustle begins below—a kettle hisses, chairs scrape on the stone floor, and the aroma of breakfast.

The inn sits in uncharacteristic quietude. The closure of the port reduces the throng of patrons to a solitary family. The two men, faces etched with a mix of weariness and resolve, share a familial air with the twin tiefling girls beside them. The girls, eyes bright with a hint of mischief, wear garments that meld practicality with the faintest nod to whimsy— simple tunics adorned with bright stitching. Their departure is noticed only as the door swings closed behind them, the morning light framing their retreating figures in a brief tableau.

As the door closes behind the departing family, Bortock greets the party with his customary cheer. His jovial demeanor is a beacon of warmth against the inn’s quiet backdrop. “Well met, travelers!” he calls out. “Elro was around last night, looking for you lot. Said he’d swing by again soon. Seems eager for some news.”

Halite, ever the inquisitive mind, takes the opportunity to engage Bortock, his curiosity piqued. “What can you tell us about Croaker Cave?” he inquires, leaning in slightly.

Bortock’s expression shifts subtly to one of caution, the merriment in his eyes tempered by the weight of his words. “Croaker Cave, you say? They call it that for good reason—the croaks of giant ice frogs echo from there, a sound that’d chill your bones if the cold hadn’t already. None of the village folk dare set foot inside. They know where to find it, sure, but it’s an unspoken rule here: no one goes into that cave.”

The party settles into a corner table. Their breakfast— simple fare that consists of warm bread, savory stew, and fish— is quickly served, and five silver pieces are dutifully deducted from their collective inventory. As steam rises from their mugs, mingling with the scents beckoning from the kitchen, Kragor turns to Bortock, his curiosity unabated.

“What can you tell us about Hulil?” Kragor inquires, his gaze steady as he delves into the topic of the enigmatic sisters. “You mentioned knowing something about her sister Tulgi, before.”

Bortock scratches his beard thoughtfully, his eyes narrowing as he sifts through what bits of information he possesses. “Ah, Tulgi,” he begins slowly, weighing his words. “Can’t say I knew she had a sister. These folks from Shadycreek Run— always a tangled web with them. Their kin aren’t exactly welcome with open arms in Palebank. Suspicion tends to follow their kind.” The room falls silent for a moment, the crackle of the hearth the only sound, as the party absorbs this insight into the community’s undercurrents.

Then Kragor, ever pragmatic, inquires about another concern weighing on their minds. “What about healing potions? Do you know where we might procure some?”

With a nod of understanding, Bortock leans in slightly, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial tone. “Aye, there’s a place by the docks—a rickety shack run by an old elf woman named Gramini. She tends to the sick and sells a few potions. Not the cheapest, but she’s got a knack for it, if you catch my drift.”

As the party settles the last of their breakfast, Elro, the stalwart head of the Glass Blades, enters the *Jolly Dwarf* with his usual air of authority. He approaches the group, genuine concern etched upon his features. “How are you all faring? What have you uncovered since we last spoke?”

Scarlet takes the lead, relaying the fruits of their investigation. “We’ve traced connections between Tulgi, her sister Hulil, and the affliction spreading through Palebank. There’s also Verla, the owner of Pelc’s Curiosities, who met a tragic end.” She pauses, gauging Elro’s reaction.

Though Elro is unaware of Hulil specifically, he had suspected ties to the Shadycreek Run families. “We’ve long had our suspicions about those families,” Elro admits, nodding in understanding. “Their presence is like a shadow over the village. We don’t take kindly to their brand of trouble.”

Upon learning of Verla’s fate, a solemn expression clouds his face, a brief but sincere tribute to a fallen villager. Scarlet continues, letting him know that they encountered bandits at Pelc’s, many of whom they dispatched. Elro’s demeanor lightens slightly at this news. “Good work. A few less of those rats to worry about. I’ll send some of my people over to handle the aftermath,” he assures, a faint smile of approval playing on his lips.

Still curious about their next venture, Whisper inquires, “What makes Croaker's Cave particularly dangerous?” Elro turns towards her, his gaze steady. “It’s the giant ice frogs. Those are the reason folks steer clear.”

Scarlet, drawing from her vast trove of natural knowledge, leans forward. “How large are these frogs?” she asks.

“About the size of a large wolf,” Elro replies, conjuring a vivid image in their minds.

Scarlet nods, familiar with their temperate climate counterparts. She addresses the party. “I recall they aren’t venomous, but they can certainly swallow a person whole. Their stomach acid dissolves their prey, and while they’re smarter than regular frogs, they’re not what you would call cunning. I knew a teacher once who kept one as a pet.”

Whisper, ever cautious, presses further. “Are there other creatures there?” A shrug is Elro’s only response, his expression speaking to the uncertainty that envelops the cave. “To be honest, nobody really knows. Few would venture near.”

Before parting ways, Elro wraps up their exchange with a request. “Please, continue your efforts to root out these Shadycreek Run folk. The village would be greatly indebted.”

The party, girded by Elro’s trust and responsibility, reflects on the tapestry they are unraveling— a tapestry that now leads them to the hidden depths of Croaker’s Cave and the shadows lurking within.

## Adventuring’s hard, let’s go shopping

Braving the biting cold, the party makes their way to the docks. The docks stretch before them like a latticework of well-worn paths and weather-beaten shanties, each structure an echo of days long gone. They navigate through the winding lanes until they reach the shack they seek, a structure that barely seems to stand, its planks askew and its angles nothing more than a faint memory of their intended rightness. A faded sign declaring “Goods for Sale” hangs haphazardly above the door, its generic promise as unassuming as the building it adorns.

Elara is pushed to the forefront as the party’s chosen negotiator. Halite steps forward to open the door for her, the movement releasing the sharp clang of a bell. The room within is cloaked in shadow, save for the flickering light of a small fire behind the counter. The interior is a curious cacophony of clutter, shelves bowing beneath the weight of trinkets and curiosities that defy categorization.

From behind the counter emerges Gramini, a wizened elf woman. She stands, her silhouette a testament to the passage of time, a blue scarf wrapped snugly around her head and tucked beneath her chin. Her coat hangs loosely about her frame, a shield against the perpetual chill that seeps through the shanty’s thin walls. Her eyes, sharp and discerning despite her age, flicker with a cautious curiosity as she takes in the newcomers.

“Well, well, what’s this? Not often lately do I have a party of adventurers darken my doorstep.” Her voice is a blend of rasp and warmth, much like the flickering fire that battles the cold at her side. “What brings you to my humble abode? Do you seek a trinket, perhaps? Or is it something more you’re after?”

Elara steps forward, her eyes meeting Gramini’s as she broaches the subject of potions. “We’re investigating this freezing illness that has blighted the village. We heard you might have some potions for sale. Do you have anything that could help us with what lies ahead?”

Gramini’s expression shifts slightly, her eyes gleaming with a mix of sympathy and practicality. “Ah, you must be asking about that poor soul, Urgon. I’m afraid I don’t have anything that could have cured his peculiar ailment—  such things are woven with magic and mystery far beyond the reach of my humble concoctions. But I do keep a few basics on hand for those venturing to Eiselcross. Dangerous place, that is, and buyers do come through fairly quickly.”

The old elf reaches beneath the counter and brings forth a small tray, each vial nestled snugly in its own cushioned nook. “I have four health potions left. Normally, they sell for 60 gold pieces each, but business is a mite slow lately. I’ll let you have them for 50 gold pieces each.”

Sensing an opportunity, Elara leans in, her voice taking on a persuasive tone. “Would you consider letting them go for, say, 30 gold pieces each? We’re in a bit of a bind, and the road ahead could be perilous.”

Gramini chuckles softly, a sound that speaks of both kindness and shrewdness. “Below my costs, Sweetie? Now, that wouldn’t do. But you’re charming, I’ll give you that.” She pauses, assessing Elara as if weighing her words against some unseen scale. “Alright, 48 gold pieces each. That’s my final offer. Let’s say it’s a gesture of goodwill, shall we?”

As Elara considers the offer, she feels the weight of both Gramini’s words and her own hopefulness. This small victory, achieved through persistence and charm, brightens the shadows in the shanty, a brief respite in the village’s eternal gloom.

With their business transaction concluded, Elara lingers a moment longer, curiosity getting the better of her. “Gramini,” she begins, her voice a gentle probe, “have you heard any interesting tales or rumors as of late? Anything that might guide or even warn us?”

Gramini eases back into her chair, the fire’s warmth at her back, and lets out a contemplative sigh. “Ah, these are troubling times, indeed,” she replies, her eyes reflecting the weight of her words. “Why, just recently, they went and closed the port. No ships in or out. It’s as if Palebank is holding its breath, waiting for the storm to pass.”

She pauses, her gaze drifting past Elara to some distant point of memory or foreboding. “And as you know, there’s that freezing disease that’s been making the rounds. A chill that eats away at a person’s very core. I tell you, I’ve seen a lot come and go in my time, but I’ve a mind to think this curse has its roots in Aeor. That place is a cradle of ancient magic and lost dangers.” Gramini’s voice drops to a conspiratorial whisper, her eyes locking with Elara’s, imparting both warning and wisdom. “Oh, the folks here depend on the goods brought back from those icy wastes; it’s true enough, my livelihood included. But mark my words, not a thing good ever came out of Aeor that didn’t carry a price, and a heavy one at that.”

Curiosity satisfied, Elara begins to mentally tally the cost of the potions. Mindful of their dwindling coins, Elara proposes another angle to secure the potions. “Perhaps we might barter?” she suggests, glancing meaningfully at the others.

Kragor, catching on, reaches into their stash and pulls out the shirt emblazoned with the name of the famous bard. “Do you happen to know of Scanlan Shorthalt?” he inquires slyly, holding the shirt aloft for Gramini to see. Gramini’s eyes light up, a spark of recognition dancing in their depths. “Oh yes, I’ve seen him perform! A wonderful talent.” Her voice carries the warmth of fond remembrance, a rare indulgence amidst her business dealings.

Kragor presents the shirt, and Gramini’s interest deepens, her fingers brushing reverently against the fabric. “Hmm, why, I’ll take 15 gold off the price of a potion for that,” she proposes, her offer tangled with both practicality and delight.

With childlike excitement, Gramini tries the shirt on for size, its fabric draping over her slight frame. Scarlet, ever helpful, offers to adjust the fit, but Gramini waves her away with a playful defiance. “Oh, I’ll sort it out myself!” she insists, the garment transforming her with its vibrant allure. As Gramini twirls, the shirt’s cheerful colors catch the firelight, and she exclaims, “Scanlan was so charming!” Her voice carries a youthful timbre, as if the bard’s magic had momentarily transcended time and space to touch her once more.

The exchange seals the deal, and Gramini, newly adorned, beams at the party. “You have made my week!” she declares, her gratitude as palpable as the warmth of the fire behind her. With their potions secured and spirits lifted, the adventurers take their leave, buoyed by their success and Gramini’s unexpected joy.

## Doctor Pepe

As the party approaches Croaker Cave, they note smoke spiraling upward from a natural chimney, etching the sky with its ashen tendrils. Despite the spectral warning, the front opening of the cave appears unguarded, its dark maw beckoning the adventurers toward the mysteries and perils hidden within.

Unbeknownst to them, the rogue that Whisper had previously encountered lies in wait, having shadowed the party from Palebank. As they draw nearer, he steps free of the forest’s embrace, his presence a sudden ripple in the serene tableau.

“Hail, Friends! I mean you no harm,” he calls out, raising his hands in a gesture of peace. “I have something I believe you need to know.”

Scarlet and Whisper exchange glances before fixing their gazes upon the rogue. Recognition flickers in Whisper’s eyes, a soft chuckle escaping her lips as she recalls their prior exchange on the rooftops of Pelc’s Curiosities. Scarlet’s expression is more guarded as she steps forward, her tone firm yet open. “Who are you?” she demands, her eyes narrowing with a blend of caution and curiosity. “And what do you want?”

The rogue, sensing the weight of Scarlet’s inquiry, spreads his arms in a gesture of openness. “Let me introduce myself. I am called Doctor Pepe,” he announces. “I assure you, I was not part of the bandits you encountered before. Like you, I’ve been drawn into the orbit of this mystery, investigating the source of this debilitating disease afflicting the village.”

Kragor steps forward, his bearing equal parts caution and curiosity. “Well met, Doctor Pepe. What do you know of this cave?”

“Just before daybreak, I witnessed three cloaked figures enter the cave— a dwarf and two elves, if I’m not mistaken.” Doctor Pepe’s eyes, sharp and perceptive, scan the adventurers’ faces, gauging their reaction. “Whatever transpires within those shadowed halls, it may well relate to the affliction that has beset Palebank.”

The party exchanges thoughtful glances. After weighing their options, the adventurers come to a shared conclusion. Offering the rouge a nod of acceptance, Kragor extends the group’s unspoken consensus. “Then let us consider you an ally, Doctor Pepe. Together, we may better contend with whatever lies within the heart of Croaker Cave.”

## A cautious entry

As the party assesses the scene at the cave entrance, Elara’s sharp eyes catch sight of myriad footprints— heavy and light, large and small— tracing paths both in and out of the cavern’s yawning mouth.

Gathering in a tight circle, they weigh their options and decide on a reconnaissance mission. It is swiftly determined that Doctor Pepe, with his keen investigative insights, and Whisper, with her silent grace, will venture in to scout the darkness and report back to the group.

To aid them in the shadowy depths, Elara steps forward and gently strums her harp, weaving magic through its strings. She sings, “Sol invictus,” and with her melody, a spare dagger that Doctor Pepe holds aloft begins to glow. The light emanating from the blade now serves as both a beacon and a ward against the shadows lurking within the cave.

As Doctor Pepe and Whisper step cautiously into the cave, the world narrows around them to the soft glow of magical light. The air grows cooler, the dampness clinging to their skin like an insistent whisper. About ten feet in, they encounter a pool of water, its murky depths disturbed only by the occasional ripple from droplets falling from above.

Whisper, pausing to scan the area, notes that the ceiling, though ten feet high, bristles with stalactites, reducing the navigable space to eight feet. The constant drip of water echoes in the chamber, joined intermittently by the deep croaks of unseen amphibians. These sounds seem to resonate with the very bones of the cave, sending a shiver across her fur.

Doctor Pepe, moving with deliberate quiet, approaches the pool’s edge to gain a better vantage. He squints across the still water, and on the far side, he discerns the tip of a wooden beam jutting slightly from the shadows. Suddenly he recalls that the three figures he saw entering the cave earlier were carrying a beam: this must be the way across.

## Ambushed

However, their surreptitious exploration meets a hiccup as Whisper, following closely behind, stubs her paw on a jagged stalagmite, an uncharacteristic slip of her usual feline grace. She releases a sharp hiss, the sound punctuating the hush like a whispered exclamation.

In that moment of unexpected noise, the cave seems to hold its breath, as if noting their presence. Sure enough, the murky pool erupts with life. From the dark waters leap two massive blue frogs, their slick, amphibious forms catching the faint light with an unsettling gleam. Each of them, easily the size of a mastiff, lands with a splash, their movements swift and predatory as their croaks reverberate through the cavern.

The first frog targets Doctor Pepe, its powerful legs propelling it toward him with startling agility. Its maw, wide and wet, snaps at his leg with a ferocity born of hunger, but the doctor’s reflexes are sharp. He sidesteps with practiced ease, feeling the air rush past him as the frog’s jaws close on empty air.

Meanwhile, the second frog’s attention locks onto Whisper. With a sudden lurch, it fastens its jaws around her, seriously wounding her. Its coarse tongue feels rough against her fur as it pins her with a vice-like grip. Whisper’s world constricts around the raw strength of the creature, her body momentarily immobilized by the force of its bite.

Summoning her inner reserves of strength and agility, Whisper wrests herself free with a surge of determination. Her eyes flash with a fierce resolve as, in a counterstrike, she slashes her claws across the frog’s face. Her nails carve shallow lines into its slick skin, the tiny rivulets of crimson barely visible against its deep blue hue.

---

Outside the cave, the rest of the party stands poised at the entrance, their senses attuned to the subtle shifts in the air and the echoing sounds from within. The moment they hear the telltale sounds of combat— the splash of water, the guttural croaks, and Whisper’s attack slicing through the air with a fierce whoosh— they spring into action, their instincts honed for battle.

Elara, her eyes narrowing with resolve, strides forward and gestures to the entrance. “They’re in trouble,” she calls to her comrades, her voice urgent but steady. “We need to move!”

---

Amidst the chaos of the cave, Doctor Pepe and Whisper’s senses are suddenly heightened, picking up the unmistakable sound of boots scraping against stone. The rhythmic footfalls echo ominously, suggesting the approach of yet another unknown presence. But with danger already pressing in from all sides, they have little choice but to focus on the immediate threat before them.

With practiced efficiency, Doctor Pepe shifts his attention to the wounded frog, its massive eyes glinting with a primal mix of hunger and pain. He grips his shortsword tightly and stabs the frog, its skin giving way under the sharp edge. He follows through with his dagger, driving it deep into the frog’s mammoth head eliciting a guttural croak from its gaping maw. The frog’s body shudders as it recoils, its eyes momentarily losing focus.

However, momentarily it recovers its resolve and launches itself again at Doctor Pepe. With a quick, forceful snap, the creature’s wide mouth closes around his side, its teeth sinking into flesh and fabric alike. The amphibian’s strength is undeniable, its powerful jaws grappling him with a tenacity forged in the wild. Doctor Pepe grunts in pain and surprise, fighting against the pull of the creature’s embrace as it anchors him in place.

Beside them, the first frog, still stinging from Whisper’s attack, attempts a tactical retreat, eyeing the safety of the murky depths. As it begins to slink back into the water, Whisper retaliates instinctively, her claws slicing through the air. But her strike goes wide, slashing only the space where the frog’s flesh had been moments before, a low growl of frustration rumbling in her throat.

Vexed, Whisper turns her attention fully to the frog besetting Doctor Pepe. Her eyes narrow with intent, and with a fierce swipe, she lashes at the creature, her claws finding flesh and drawing fresh and thick lines of blood. The frog shudders under the assault, its movements momentarily disrupted by the sudden, sharp pain.

Recognizing that in her current condition she cannot survive another assault, Whisper makes a calculated decision. With nimble grace, she disengages from the melee, slipping back out the cave entrance.

## Reinforcements on both sides

As Whisper emerges from the cave, Halite’s eyes quickly assess the situation, the urgency of the rogue’s plight igniting a fire within him. With decisive speed, he charges into the cavern, the air rippling with the strength of his resolve. The weight of his trident is a familiar comfort, its barbed prongs glinting ominously in the ethereal light cast by the enchanted dagger.

Inside, Doctor Pepe struggles against the powerful jaws of the frog, its grip relentless and unyielding. Halite closes the distance with powerful strides, each step a testament to his formidable presence. With a calculated thrust, he drives his trident into the creature’s sinewy side, the prongs embedding deeply into its flesh. Nonetheless, the frog’s tenacious hold on Doctor Pepe does not falter, its instinctive determination proving a formidable adversary.

Elara, observing the struggle, draws forth her harp and weaves a melody that dances through the air like a silken breeze. Each note carries with it a gift of possibility and essence of courage. Doctor Pepe feels an invigorating surge through his veins. “Remember your agility and cunning!” her voice calls out, ringing with a warmth that soothes his panic. “This moment is yours to seize; you have the strength to break free!”

She then raises her hands in a graceful arc, summoning the celestial power within her. Her voice rings clear and potent with arcane command as she conjures radiant energy to coil around her fingers before launching it toward the frog with unerring precision. The mote of light strikes with an incandescent glow, the fury of the stars released.

The frog releases a guttural croak of distress, shuddering and convulsing under the radiant onslaught. It releases Doctor Pepe, its massive form collapsing lifelessly into the pool, sending ripples through the dark water as it sinks into its depths.

Doctor Pepe, now free from the beast’s grip, exhales with palpable relief, his mind a rush of gratitude and newfound respect for his companions.

The atmosphere in the cavern shifts rapidly from relief to renewed tension as Kragor taps into his ancestral gift of inner vigor. With a deep, guttural grunt, he ignites the raw power within his blood, coursing through him like wildfire. His muscles tense with readiness, his senses sharpening as he bolsters his defenses. He repositions himself swiftly, his war hammer gleaming ominously in the soft light, preparing for whatever threat may arise from the shadows.

But danger has already taken root in the darkness. Without warning, a crossbow bolt zings through the dim air, striking Doctor Pepe true. The severe impact draws a gasped cry of pain as the projectile buries itself deep.

Simultaneously, another bolt cuts through the air with a whispering menace, skimming just past Halite with a sharp snap, narrowly missing him. A third missile flies and finds its mark, striking Halite solidly. But the goliath’s skin, tough and resilient, absorbs most of the impact, mitigating what might have been a grievous injury into a mere bruise.

Through the haze of battle, Halite’s keen eyes finally catch sight of the assailants across the murky pool. Three cloaked figures stand poised— apparently the dwarf and two elves that Doctor Pepe spotted earlier— their silhouettes lit by the faint reflections on the water’s surface. Crossbows in hand, they are seen taking aim with dangerous intent.

Outside the cave, Scarlet springs into action upon seeing Whisper’s wounds. Her focus sharpens as she crosses the distance between them, her heart guided by compassion and determination. With gentle hands, she channels the soothing energies of nature, Whisper’s injuries knit together under the healing touch. Newly healed and teeming with energy, Whisper darts back into the cave entrance with feline agility. Her sling whirls through the air with a practiced motion, a stone arcing toward the elf who stands by the wooden beam. A satisfying “oof!” indicates the effectiveness of her aim. In a fluid movement, she skips back outside with effortless grace.

Inside the cave, Doctor Pepe, undeterred by his own pain, lines up a shot with his crossbow against one of the elusive elves cloaked in shadow. His aim falters, the bolt flying wide and clattering harmlessly against the stone. Unbowed, he reassesses, ready for another chance to aid his companions.

Seizing the opportunity, Halite steps forward, his eyes fixed on the same target Whisper wounded. With a powerful throw, he sends a javelin hurtling through the air. The weapon embeds itself deeply in the elf, who crumples with a gasp before toppling into the pool, his life extinguished in an instant.

Elara, standing ready, contemplates leaping across the pool but decides against it, the chasm too daunting. Instead, she focuses her divine energy, firing another brilliant mote of light across the water. It strikes the second elf squarely in the chest. Radiance pulses through him, the light consuming the darkness even as it burns.

Kragor, eyes narrowing in focus, peers through the shadows at the elf struck by Elara’s magic. “Te exsecro” he whispers, dark power spilling from his lips, shooting across the cavern, and briefly enveloping the elf with malice. Following swiftly, he unleashes jagged tendrils pulsing with a deep violet hue from his hand, the forceful energy striking the elf with a devastating blow. Knocked off his feet, the elf disappears beneath the water’s surface, his form vanishing into the depths.

The dwarf’s vehement expletive echoes off the stone walls— “Fuck!”, a singular utterance charged with frustration and fear. Determined not to become another victim of the party’s prowess, he raises his crossbow with frantic urgency, taking aim at Elara. The bolt sings through the air, and with cruel accuracy, it hits Elara in the thigh with a painful thud. She gasps, swaying slightly, the sharp sting of the wound momentarily clouding her focus.

Even as the bolt strikes, the dwarf retreats further into the depths of the cave, his footsteps a hurried rhythm fading into the shadows. The echo of his passage is swallowed by the cavernous gloom, leaving only the rhythmic dripping of water and the distant murmur of unseen currents.

## Crossing the pool

Faced with the challenge of pursuing the fleeing dwarf across the frigid pool, the party assesses their options. The wooden beam that seems to have been used by the bandits, sits tantalizingly across the water.

Scarlet, eyes focused and determined, retrieves her grappling hook, whirling it with precision before casting it toward the beam. The hook clatters against the rock, missing its intended target. Undeterred, she begins to reel the rope back in, but suddenly, it snags on something unseen beneath the water’s surface. Her grip tightens instinctively as she braces against the unexpected resistance, her muscles tensing with each abrupt jerk on the line.

Sensing the uncertainty, Halite strides forward to join her, his massive frame and steady strength offering assistance. Together, they pull against the hidden weight, the rope trembling intermittently as whatever lies at its end struggles or moves. The dim glow at the water’s edge catches their attention, revealing as their prize emerges— an entangled mass of a downed bandit and a still-living frog gripping it.

The unsettling sight surprises them both, the frog writhing with instinctual panic as the dead weight of the bandit drags it upward. Halite and Scarlet step back, their expressions mingling curiosity and caution as the frog’s eyes glimmer in the enchanted light.

Kragor, watching from the cave mouth, recognizes the unfolding threat. He wastes no time, casting a hex upon the amphibious creature, followed immediately by a blast of eldritch power from his outstretched hand. The creature’s form practically disintegrates with the impact.

Elara takes a precious moment to steady herself. Her hands glow softly with divine power, tending to the wound at her thigh where the dwarf’s bolt had found its mark. Under the soothing warmth of her own magic, the skin knits back together seamlessly.

Nearby, Scarlet mirrors Elara’s actions, rushing to Doctor Pepe’s side with urgency and care. Her hands emit a healing glow as she channels nature’s restorative energies into him, the warmth spreading through his body and mending the rent skin and bruised tissue.

But the moment of reprieve is fleeting. From the gloom beyond, the dwarf reemerges, a spectral figure in the cave’s shadows. His crossbow is raised with grim determination, the bolt loosing with a whistle through the chilled air. It glances off Halite’s armor harmlessly, the goliath’s formidable protection turning aside the would-be threat.

“Damn it,” Doctor Pepe grumbles, frustration etched into his features. “We need to see the far shore!” His mind races back to Elara’s earlier sorcerous tune, building an idea around its luminous inspiration. Taking his enchanted dagger, he hurls it with hope and precision toward where he suspects the beam might lie, a beacon against the obscurity engulfing them.

With a dull thud, the dagger strikes true, embedding in the wooden beam at the edge of the pool. Its radiant glow shines forth, casting stark light upon the distant shore and illuminating the mystery of the far side. Shadows retreat, replaced by clarity and the hard lines of the cave’s rocky expanse.

Driven by a surge of impatience, Whisper springs into action. The cave’s dim atmosphere an invigorating playground for her feline senses, she leaps toward the nearest wall, her sharp claws finding purchase in the rugged stone. Her ascent is swift, and she crests over the pool’s expanse, her path arching toward the heart of the cave. She lands silently on the far side without a sound. Her keen eyes pierce the low light, and deeper within she can make out the dwarf, a singular figure carved from the subterranean depths.

Halite, with a practiced flick of his wrist, throws the grappling hook, the line unfurling in a smooth arc through the air. The hook catches the wooden beam with uncanny accuracy, and with a powerful tug, he pulls the makeshift bridge across the pool’s surface until it rests securely on their side. He charges confidently across the board, his powerful frame balancing with ease as he joins Whisper on the far shore.

Kragor is close at his heels, the energy of their earlier actions still coursing through him. His senses keen and alert, he rushes across the makeshift bridge, anticipation fueling each stride as he reaches the other side.

Meanwhile, the dwarf, hidden away deeper in the cave and visible only to Whisper, reacts with startled haste. Unnerved by the sudden approach, he raises his crossbow and fires. The bolt flies wide, clattering harmlessly against the stone wall— a futile attempt to deter the advancing intruders.

Scarlet, agile and quick, follows them across the wooden plank. Her resolve firm, she conjures a flame in her hand, the warm glow chasing away the shadows that linger. The flickering firelight illuminates their path, a beacon for those less fortunate in the art of navigating the dark.

Bringing up the rear, Doctor Pepe retrieves his glowing dagger, its light a reliable friend against the gloom. With it secured, he follows the last of his companions across, the path of the board beneath his feet firm and steady.

## On the offensive

With the dwarf now visible in the dim light, Whisper, poised and predatory, rushes forward to capitalize on the surprise. Her speed blurs in the cave’s shadows, and with a swift swipe of her paw, she aims to catch the dwarf off-guard. However, he responds with surprisingly quick reflexes, his shield meeting her strike with a resonant thud that reverberates through the cavern, her claws harmlessly skidding off the polished surface.

Halite follows closely behind, his eyes fixed on the dwarf. With a powerful throw, he launches his javelin through the air, piercing the dwarf with a clean, precise strike. The force of it drives him to the ground, his life’s thread hanging by a fragile strand as he fights to remain conscious.

As Elara reaches the scene, she leaps nimbly off the board, maneuvering around Kragor in an agile move that speaks of confidence and coordination. With her gaze fixed upon the fallen dwarf, she commands the space between them, her voice carrying the sharp edge of authority. “Tell us the secrets of this place,” she demands, her insistence filled with the gravity of their shared mission.

But the dwarf, his mind clouded by pain and desperation, does not respond. His eyes remain dull, unyielding, the secrets he holds tightly kept within his stern silence. Sensing the resistance, Kragor steps forward, his powerful voice interjecting into the charged air. “When a lady speaks, you damn well better listen,” he rumbles, his presence a formidable echo of Elara’s urgency. Yet even this assertion fails to penetrate the dwarf’s resolve, the words reverberating emptily against the unhearing silence.

---

Halite asks him “What family are you with?” “The Uttolot family.” “What are you doing in this cave?”
“I work here, for Hulil. We’re feeding them.”
“There is a lot more of us, but Hulil sent a bunch of us into town because she’s sick. She’s looking for a cure. They didn’t come back.”
He removes the javelin and starts to bandage his wound.

“Hulil will soon go to Shady Creek Run to sell the junk that Tulgi got. She wants a cure.”

Halite glowers at the dwarf.
“What else is in here?”
“A bunch of giant frogs. We were feeding them these bats, to train them to carry us across.”

Scarlet asks about the feeding. “They used to eat more people. But we keep them fed.”
Dr. Pepe notices the bucket of bats and picks them up.

Whisper says “Dwarf, tell me about traps that might be in here.” “There’s a bedroll covering a pit.” He points out the sleeping quarters.

Looting: crappy scimitars; one more light crossbow; 7 gp; 10 sp.

The party ties dwarf’s hands and lead him through. Then they continue through the cavern, discovering the bed rolls and fire bit.

Dr. Pepe sees the bed roll stretched over a bit.

Whisper lights the fire with Druidcraft.

The party investigates the area, and finds an unopened bottle of Bald Dwarf whiskey. (Made by elves, approximately 25 gp.)

The party splits to go down the two corridors. Halite and Dr. Pepe run into a swarm of bats. Halite stabs the air wildy with his trident, and strikes a stalagmite. The two of them run back up the corridor.

Kragor sees the big pool.
I demand that the dwarf tell us what is on the other side and how to get across.
Old Croaker ferries people across.

Then we see a huge (even for a giant frog) frog approaching.
Scarlet approaches him and she strokes her head.
Dr. Pepe throws him a treat.

Elara rides Old Croaker across the pool.
Once she’s at the edge, she sees two praying figures at an altar.
Tapestry with a dragon. A dwarf woman and male elf.
The fire in the middle of the cavern is huge.
The dwarf has the signs of the disease.
They both wear robes matching the tapestry.

Everybody crosses the pool except Whisper, who stays with the bound dwarf.

Scarlet recognizes the imagery on the tapestry.
Tiamat is the scaled tyrant, and the evil goddess of dragons.
Greed. Sworn enemy of the Platinum dragon.
One of the betrayer gods.

The two figures look up.
The dwarf (presumed Hulil) demands that we drop our weapons and explain ourselves.

Elara decides to say that the “dragons” sent us to understand the origin of this disease.
Hulil is having none of it, and becomes hostile.


Kragor hexes the elf, and attempts to hit them with a blast, but misses.
Scarlet casts shillelagh and runs to swing at the elf. She misses.
Dr. Pepe shoots the elf in the neck, downing him.

Halite throws his javelin at Hulil, stabbing her in the hip. She looks down at the javelin and commands him to flee in response, but it has no effect.

Hulil casts a spell causing a sword with a dragon claw pomel appear. It swings at Halite, missing.

Elara shoots her shortbow at Hulil, hitting her in the shoulder.

Kragor hexes Hulil, but misses hitting another stalagmite.

Whisper, hearing the commotion ahead, knocks out the dwarf.

Dr Pepe shoots. A solid hit. She’s heavily wounded. A second javelin from Halite misses.

Hulil reaches out a hand and summons a sickly green & jagged blade. She swings at Halite, but the blade bounces off his armor. She then pulls out a potion and quaffs it and immediately looks much better again.

Elara casts dissonant whispers which disrupts Hulil a bit.

Kragor hits Hulil with his Eldritch Blast.

Scarlet strikes with her quarterstaff, bludgeoning Hulil in her jaw. She’s starting to look angry and worn down.

Whisper attempts to scamper across the cave wall to join the party, but falls into the water. Old Croaker is startled by the splash, and snaps at Whisper, missing.
Whisper swims away from Old Croaker and starts climbing the wall again.

Dr. Pepe fires again, with a deadly hit.

Halite hears splashing back at the cavern. He doesn’t lose focus and stabs Hulil again. She falls unconscious.

Old Croaker leaps at Whisper, but cannot quite reach her.

Elara casts speak with animals, and tries to convince Old Croaker that if you take us back across we’ll give you more food.
But croaker wants this kitten sandwich.

Kragor hexes the frog, but again misses him.

Elara sighs, “Who needs enemies with friends like these.”

Whisper scrambles away into the main cavern and drops down to the floor. “Fucking frog! and no bats!”

Dr. Pepe shoots in the frog’s direction in the dark, but wildly misses.

Halite removes a hand from the elf.

Old Croaker lurches at Elara, attempting again to bite but misses.
Elara offers the frog the hand of the elf… it sits back and opens his mouth like a baby bird.
Halite tosses the hand into the frog. It sneaks back.

We look around the room and the bodies, but no keys.
8 gp and 5 sp.

Dr. Pepe examines the chest.
The lock is in the shape of a dragons head.
He sees that the lock has small pin holes with a little blue powder.
He attempts to disarm the trap.
He uses a leather cloth to cover his hand as he digs out the blue powder. There’s a lot, but he’s able to contain it in the skin.

Scarlet casts Detect Poison and Disease (as a ritual spell).
She detects magical contagion in the bag and in the chest, and she also senses the frog is poisonous/venomous.

With Scarlet’s help, Dr. Pepe proceeds to lockpick the chest and peeks inside. There is a gilded scroll case, a jade statuette of a storm giant, a quiver with six +1 arrows, a silver ring with jasper stone, 800–900 coins, an old notebook.

Dr. Pepe invites others to come over.

He removes all the goods and leaves the blue powder untouched.

- 415 cp
- 234 sp
- 43 ep
- 112 gp

The notebook is a journal. She sold a blue vial to Irven Liel.

We leave the cavern.
