<p><strong>Breath Weapons:</strong> The Dragon is able to use its breath
but three times per day, so sometimes it will bite instead. To determine
this simply roll two six-sided dice; a score of six or less indicates
the Dragon will bite, but a seven or better indicates it will
breathe.</p>
<p>Cone-shaped breath weapons originate from the mouth of the Dragon at
1/2” diameter.</p>
<p>Line-shaped breath weapons will travel in a straight line beginning
at the height of the Dragon’s head at the time it releases.</p>
<p>Cloud-shaped breath weapons extend from ground level to a height of
3”.</p>
<p><strong>Hit Dice:</strong> The number of dice is an indication of the
size of the creature. Most will fall in the middle, but 20% will be
small and 20% very large. The value of the hit dice, as well as the
value of the breath weapon, will be subject to the maturity of the
Dragon.</p>

<p>Dragons come in many colors, sizes, shapes, and alignments. Two sorts
of dragons (the Chromatic Dragon and the Platinum Dragon) are singular
individuals, and there are no others of their type. Each dragon sort
will be treated individually hereafter. General information and common
characteristics will be given here.</p>
<p>The ten species of dragons have three general size categories (small,
average, and huge) according to the size typical of each. This
categorization is determined by die roll. An 8-sided die is rolled: 1-2
= small, 3-7 = average, 8 = huge. This size determination indicates the
number of hit dice a dragon has.</p>
<p>Dragons pass through eight ages in their lives. These growth stages
are:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">1. <strong>Very young</strong> — 1-5
years</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">— 1 hit point per die</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">2. <strong>Young</strong> — 6-15
years</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">— 2 hit point per die</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">3. <strong>Sub-adult</strong> — 16-25
years</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">— 3 hit point per die</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">4. <strong>Young adult</strong> — 26-50
years</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">— 4 hit point per die</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">5. <strong>Adult</strong> — 51-100
years</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">— 5 hit point per die</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">6. <strong>Old</strong> — 101-200
years</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">— 6 hit point per die</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">7. <strong>Very old</strong> — 201-400
years</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">— 7 hit point per die</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">8. <strong>Ancient</strong> — 401 +
years</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">— 8 hit point per die</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>To determine the age (and thus the number of hit points per die a
dragon has) simply roll an 8-sided die, the number rolled indicating the
age as shown above.</p>
<p>All dragons see equally well in daylight or darkness (infravision,
60’). They have excellent sight, smell, and hearing. Because of these
keen senses, all dragons are able to <em>detect hidden</em> or
<em>invisible</em> creatures within 1” per age level. Dragons also
develop the power to panic enemies as they mature. At <em>adult</em> age
and older they radiate a powerful aura which causes a fear</p>
<p><strong>Treasure:</strong> <em>Very young</em> dragons will usually
have no treasure, but there is a 10% chance that they will have
one-quarter the possible listed treasure. <em>Young</em> dragons have
25% chance for one-quarter the possible listed treasure.
<em>Sub-adults</em> have a 50% chance for one-half the possible listed
treasure. <em>Young adults</em>, and <em>old</em> dragons have normal
treasure. <em>Very old</em> and <em>ancient</em> dragons are 50% and 75%
likely to have 150% and 200% respectively of the listed treasure.</p>
<p><strong>Weaknesses of Dragons:</strong> The innate cowardice of
dragonkind is shown by the fact most can be subdued. Dragons’ egoistic
nature makes them subject to flattery, and it also makes the more stupid
of them prone to attack other powerful creatures whom they view as
disputing their dominating position. Greed and avarice are major
motivating factors in all but the loftiest of dragons (40% of silver,
80% of gold, and the platinum dragon), so they are subject to
manipulation by very clever persons or the prospect of actual treasure
and the promise of more forthcoming.</p>

<p>White dragons favor chilly or cold regions in which to dwell. They
lair in icy caves or deep subterranean places. Although not as
intelligent as most other dragons, they are as evil and greedy as
any.</p>
<p>The white dragon is able to attack with a claw/claw/bite or with its
breath weapon — a cone of cold (frost) 7” long with a base diameter of
2½”.</p>
<p>Rare magic-using white dragons are able to employ a maximum of four
1st level spells, gaining one at each even-numbered (2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th)
age bracket, i.e. one spell at <em>young</em> age, a second at <em>young
adult</em> age, a third at <em>old</em> age, and the fourth at
<em>ancient</em> status. To determine spells usable, select randomly
from the 1st level spell list. Duplication is possible, merely
indicating that the dragon can use the same spell twice, thrice, or even
four times.</p>

<h3 id="customs-and-social-mores-white-dragons">Customs and Social
Mores: White Dragons</h3>
<p>Whites are the least intelligent species of western dragon, and their
behavior shows it. They have very little in the way of either foresight
or planning, and their memory is rudimentary and capable of recalling
only physical events, not abstract concepts. There’s one exception to
this: They remember offenses against them, and they have a very
well-developed sense of vengeance.</p>
<p>Unlike other dragon species, whites mate purely for pleasure. If
offspring arise from this activity, so be it, but this isn’t the goal of
the activity. Should the female become impregnated, the male
instinctively stays around to protect her. Once the eggs hatch, however,
the two creatures go their separate ways. The hatchling dragons follow
one or other of the parents, and the older dragons do not object to the
young tagging along. The parents feel no obligation to protect the
young, however, and so the offspring must learn to fend for themselves
immediately. (The infant mortality rate for white dragons is rather
high.)</p>
<p>The time at which young dragons leave their parents and strike out on
their own varies wildly. Some leave almost immediately, while others
remain for a century. In the latter case, the parent usually drives the
offspring away, sensing that it may soon become a rival. (And the parent
is sometimes right. There have been cases recorded where a young dragon
has killed its parent for the older dragon’s hoard.)</p>
<p>White dragons have been described—by other dragons—as “the thugs of
dragonkind” and as being “about as subtle as volcanoes.” Even those
lucky whites that can communicate with an intelligent creature rarely
have thoughts worth communicating.</p>
<h3 id="sightings-white-dragons">Sightings: White Dragons</h3>
<p>As might be expected from their color, whites dwell in frigid lands
where snow and ice continually cover the ground. Although whites are
sometimes found among the snowcapped peaks of the more southerly
mountains, these are usually young—and somewhat unwise—individuals that
frequently fall prey to adventuring companies from the civilized lands.
The majority of the whites live in far northerly climes, well away from
concentrations of humanity.</p>
<h3 id="reproductive-habits">Reproductive Habits</h3>
<p>The less intelligent dragons— blacks and whites—seem to have no taboo
against inbreeding, or perhaps no knowledge of its significance. For
this reason, blacks and whites often suffer the consequences of
inbreeding: numerous infertile eggs and congenital problems (both
physical and mental).</p>
<h3 id="rogues">Rogues</h3>
<p>As with humans, demihumans, and humanoids, the alignment of dragons
reflects not instinctive behavior but an intelligent choice about how
the creatures respond to the world. Certainly, dragons raised in a
society with a strong alignment are probably going to share that
alignment, but there’s no law of nature that prevents a dragon from
changing its alignment. (In fact, the consequences of changing alignment
are considerably less for a dragon than they are for a human or
demihuman. Dragons progress in power depending on their age, so they
suffer no direct ill effects from a voluntary alignment change.)</p>
<p>Dragons that voluntarily change their alignments are referred to as
“rogues,” and they’re very rare indeed. Rogues have decided for reasons
of their own that they don’t go along with the world-view common to
dragons of their species.</p>
<p>Rogue chromatic dragons are even rarer than rogue metallic dragons,
but they do occur. A young red dragon might be sickened by the suffering
that its older relatives are inflicting on innocent victims. After much
soul-searching, it might flee to an isolated area where it can live on
its own terms (Chaotic Neutral alignment), or it might try to work to
prevent or reverse damage caused by others of its kind (Chaotic, Neutral
or even Lawful Good, depending on how it went about this task).</p>
<p>In the case of Chaotic Evil dragons becoming neutral or good, their
kin respond to them in exactly the same way they would to any other
dragon of that alignment: hatred and attack if the rogue intrudes on
their territory, general indifference otherwise. Lawful Evil dragons
might consider retribution against the rogue, but only if the rogue
posed some kind of danger to them or if they saw some potential gain in
it.</p>
<h3 id="dragons-and-the-ecosystem">Dragons and the Ecosystem</h3>
<p>White dragons are notable exceptions in these matters. These
creatures seem to have no concept of population management; they feed
until an area is totally cleaned out of prey. When this happens, they’re
forced to look elsewhere for food. “Elsewhere” often means another
dragon’s territory, which leads to violent battles between the
creatures. Lack of food also sometimes causes whites to head south from
their frigid homes and feed in more populous areas (often those already
inhabited by man).</p>
<p>This insensitivity to the ecosystem and their place in it probably
explains why the active and dormant phases for white dragons are both
about two decades long. Without the long and frequent hibernation
periods, the creatures would deplete their environment to the point
where they couldn’t survive.</p>
<h3 id="rearing-dragons">Rearing Dragons</h3>
<p>Some ambitious PCs might come up with the idea of acquiring a
freshly-hatched dragon and rearing it as a pet, friend, or guardian.
While there’s nothing innately wrong with the idea, there are some
potential problems.</p>
<p>When dragons hatch, they have a strong imprinting instinct that seems
to be common to almost every creature. In other words, they consider the
first creature that they see after emerging from the egg as their
parent, and will— initially, at least—consider themselves to be of the
same race as that creature. (Human jesters sometimes go to the trouble
of incubating ducks’ eggs just so they can be present at the hatching,
and have the ducklings imprint on them. From then on, the ducklings
follow the jester around as though the human were their mother… much to
the amusement of spectators.)</p>
<p>There’s a significant problem here, however. Even the dumbest white
dragon is much smarter than a duck. The imprinting instinct is a
short-term thing for dragons, intended to help the hatchlings survive
the first month or two of life in a hostile world. After that, their
innate intelligence takes over.</p>
<p>Dragons mature mentally at about twice the rate of humans, which
means they attain their full share of intelligence and wisdom at about
ten years of age. (They’re still potentially very naive, of course,
since their experience of the world is highly limited.) Long before this
point—probably before they reach the age of five—the effect of the
imprinting vanishes, and they’ll have realized that they’re quite
different from their “parent.” How the relationship progresses from here
depends on both the treatment the dragon receives and on the nature of
the dragon.</p>
<p>Good dragons appreciate kind, respectful, and humane treatment, and
feel some indebtedness to whoever provided that treatment. No matter how
good the treatment has been, however, the dragons never feel blind
loyalty (it’s an intelligent creature, after all, quite possibly more
intelligent than the people rearing it).</p>
<p>The relationship between a well-reared good dragon and its foster
parent closely parallels that between a human parent and child. The
relationship can be close or distant, warm or stormy, depending on how
closely the world-view of the parent matches that of the dragon (with
respect to alignment, particularly). A Chaotic brass dragon in a Lawful
environment will quickly begin to chafe at the discipline, while a gold
in a Chaotic environment will quickly feel the need for a more organized
climate.</p>
<p>No matter how closely alignments and outlooks match, however, the
dragon eventually feels the need to leave home and make its own way in
the world. Again, depending on how close the relationship was during the
dragon’s formative years, the on-going relationship between parent and
dragon can range from close friendship and mutual respect to complete
indifference or even antipathy.</p>
<p>Evil dragons are a completely different story. As soon as the dragon
is old enough to recognize its true nature—perhaps five years of age—it
starts looking for ways to manipulate the relationship to suit itself.
This is true no matter what the alignment of the parent. The dragon
quickly starts pushing the limits of any discipline enforced upon
it.</p>
<p>Evil dragons don’t respond well to the good and respectful treatment
relished by their good kin. Evil chromatics would see this as weakness
in their parent, and it would tempt them to take over as soon as
possible. These dragons respect strength and power, and won’t attack
parents who are obviously much more lethal than they.</p>
<p>This is particularly true for Lawful Evil blues. They will willingly
follow and learn from an evil-aligned parent, as long as that parent
remains more powerful than they. As soon as they see the balance shift,
however, they’ll try to take over. They won’t kill the parent if they
can avoid it, but they will expect the parent to accept them as the
master from that point forward.</p>
<p>Chaotic Evil chromatics feel no loyalty or indebtedness to anybody.
The first time they’re reasonably sure they can manage it, they’ll turn
on their parents, kill them, and take everything of value.</p>
<p>The behavior patterns and abilities of unintelligent creatures are
mainly instinctive (with some exceptions such as species-specific songs
or calls]. This isn’t the case with intelligent creatures, such as
humans, demihumans, or dragons. The vast majority of abilities and
behaviors must be learned from their parents.</p>
<h4 id="flight">Flight</h4>
<p>Take the case of a hatchling dragon being reared in a human
household. How is that dragon going to learn to fly? Certainly it can
watch other winged creatures, but dragon flight is quite different from
the flight of a sparrow. It is very unlikely that the poor creature will
ever learn how to get off the ground.</p>
<p>Enterprising characters might somehow get the creature to a high spot
so it can glide (which is an instinctive behavior) and perhaps teach
itself from there the intricacies of true flight. There are problems
here, too, however. The dragon has been raised among flightless
creatures (presumably), and won’t have developed a dragon’s normal
indifference to altitude. The problems involved in getting a young gold
dragon that is afraid of heights to step off a cliff could be the center
of much enjoyable role-playing.</p>
<p>If the characters can overcome this obstacle, it’s still not clear
sailing. The ability to glide is instinctive, but only to a degree.
Dragons are intelligent, which implies that their ability to feel fear
is as great as—if not more than—that of a human. That first glide is a
potentially terrifying experience, and could cause the dragon to panic,
with potentially catastrophic results (ask any novice hang-glider). The
chance of a successful first glide is 90% (roll 1d100, with a result of
01 to 90 representing success). If the roll exceeds 90, then the dragon
has frozen and plummets to the ground. For each point by which the roll
exceeds 90, the dragon falls 10% of the total height from which it
started the glide. For example, say the dragon attempts its first glide
from a 100-foot-high cliff (the minimum altitude from which a glide can
start). The DM rolls a 91. This means that the dragon almost makes it,
but panics just before landing and falls 10 feet (the effects of falling
on dragons are discussed in a later section). If the DM had rolled 00,
the poor dragon would have panicked immediately after stepping off the
cliff, and would have plummeted the full 100 feet.</p>
<p>After an unsuccessful glide, the dragon—assuming it survived— can try
again. The experience of the fall was probably traumatic, however, and a
modifier of 1d12 is added to the success die roll for the next attempt
(i.e., the DM rolls 1d100 and 1d12, adds the results, and compares them
to the success target of 90). Although the maximum possible result is
now 112, the dragon can never fall more than 100% of the total height
from which the glide started.</p>
<p>Needless to say, it will probably be much harder for the characters
to persuade the dragon to step off into space for a second time.</p>
<p>As soon as the dragon has completed one successful glide, it never
has to make another die roll. From this point on, it can teach itself to
fly. This procedure takes 1d4+3 months. A self-taught dragon can never
fly as well as one that was raised by those of its own kind. Its
maneuverability class is one step worse (Class D), its maximum speed is
75% of what it should be (round fractions up; e.g., a self-taught brass
has a maximum flying speed of 23 rather than 30), and it can never
perform a wingover maneuver. In addition, all attacks that the dragon
attempts while flying suffer a -2 penalty to the attack roll.</p>
<p>A self-taught dragon might later be able to receive instruction from
one of its own kind, but the dragon might already have developed too
many ingrained bad habits for the instruction to remove the above
restrictions. The chance of the instruction working is 100% minus 10%
times the age category of the dragon when it receives the
instruction.</p>
<p>For example, say that a brass that taught itself to fly is now
juvenile (age category 4). If he now receives flying lessons from
another dragon, the chance of success is 60% (100 - (10x4)). The DM
rolls 1d100. If the result is 60 or less, the juvenile brass is no
longer subject to the restrictions listed above. If the result is 61 or
more, the brass’s bad habits are too ingrained for instruction to remove
them. No matter how much training the brass receives, he will always be
subject to flight restrictions. This kind of instruction takes 1d4
weeks.</p>
<h4 id="language">Language</h4>
<p>Language is also an acquired attribute. Like any other intelligent
creature, dragons can acquire a language only from another creature who
speaks that language. Thus it is quite possible for a copper dragon
never to learn the copper tongue. Dragons raised by humans generally
learn only the common tongue, unless their parent is proficient in other
languages (and wishes to teach them).</p>
<h4 id="the-hours-after-hatching">The hours after hatching</h4>
<p>Dragon hatchlings are immediately hungry, and will eat just about
anything. They are blind for the first 12-24 hours immediately after
hatching.</p>
