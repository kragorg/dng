A meticulously carved figurine, standing approximately eight inches tall, depicting a storm giant in mid-roar, with intricate details capturing the raw power and majesty of its kind. The deep green jade shimmers with veins of gold, suggesting latent magical energies, and when held during a lightning storm, the statuette seems to vibrate softly, as if resonating with the storm’s fury. Ancient runes inscribed at the base suggest it could be used in rituals to commune with primal forces of nature, potentially granting temporary insight or power related to storms.
