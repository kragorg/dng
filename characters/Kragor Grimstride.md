# Kragor Grimstride

<span class="dropcap">I am Kragor Grimstride, orphan</span>
of Bladegarden.
My parents
were proud orcs of the Righteous Brand
who gave their lives defending their city.
Or, so I was told,
although I have also heard
whispers of betrayals.
Either way,
I was left a homeless orphan
at the age of five.
Though I long to discover the truth
about my parents,
my life has consisted of little more
than the struggle to survive.

I was weaker and dumber
than the tyrannical bullies
who ruled the streets.
By deception, speed, stealth, and a silver tongue
I survived until adulthood.
I don’t know why…
maybe merely by chance…
some presence…
some thing…
from outside our realm
took an interest in me
and began whispering in my dreams—
words and images that I could not understand.
For months these dreams plagued me,
until my darkest hour.
One night
I was caught unawares
by a gang of thugs.
I struggled to fend them off
but was brought close to death.
Feeble and desperate,
despising my own weakness,
my will to live was as strong as ever.
I screamed into the void
and surrendered to whatever it was
that had been watching me.
It filled me with power
and I overcame the attackers,
killing some
and routing the others.

Since then
dream visions have continued
to haunt my slumber
and reveal the depth
of my awakened abilities.
With my war hammer raised
and eldritch energy crackling at my fingertips,
I have fought against the tyrants
at every opportunity,
protecting those they sought to exploit.

Gradually, my dreams began to make some sense—
as a command and as a promise for greater power.
“Go north. Cross the frozen north. To Eiselcross.”
The purpose remained veiled,
but my resolve was absolute.
I would follow.

I traveled six weeks
winding through Bladegarden, Hupperdook,
Nogvugrot, and Yrrosa,
until Icehaven emerged from the frost.
A Righteous Brand veteran
now seeking his own fortune
was a tale that opened purses and secured passage.
Merchants, traders, wandering groups
paid for my protection,
though my true purpose
was survival.
Traveling alone meant certain death.
Joining caravans and groups
was a matter of strategic necessity.

Dangerous encounters were rare,
but not nonexistent.
Most challenges I met with cunning and bluff,
my war hammer a sufficient deterrent.
But when serious threats pressed—
moments that demanded more than
just smashing some heads—
I would resort to my eldritch powers,
breaking the careful illusion
of a simple veteran soldier.
Sometimes those who witnessed this would withdraw,
recognizing I was something else entirely,
leaving me to continue
my calculated journey north
on my own.

Once I reached Icehaven
I made bargain
with the first captain
who would take me.
The rest you know
as we all met on board the _Frostwind_
on our way to Palebank Village.
