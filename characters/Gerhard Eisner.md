# Gerhard Eisner

Gerhard is the former captain of the *Frostfang*, rescued alongside his crewman Rorik and passenger Bret. He hails from Icehaven, from a family of fishermen who recently began ferrying passengers. He possesses a magical ring allowing him to walk on water. Deeply affected by the loss of his ship, he is travelling with the party for now, seeking rest and direction. He carries ship insurance procured from an Empire contact.
