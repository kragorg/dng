<h1 id="dungeons-gardens-synopsis">Dungeons &amp; Gardens —
Synopsis</h1>
<p><span class="dropcap">Our story unfolds in the</span> desolate
Greying Wildlands of Wildemount, within the frost-rimed confines of
Palebank Village. Here, a disparate group of adventurers— the aasimar
bard Elara, goliath fighter Halite, orc warlock Kragor, halfling druid
Scarlet, tabaxi rogue Whisper, and the enigmatic rogue Doctor Pepe— find
their paths converging. Arriving aboard the <em>Frostwind</em>, drawn by
whispers of Aeorian ruins scattered across the perilous northern islands
of Eiselcross, they disembark into a village shrouded in mourning.
Urgon, a dwarven explorer, has succumbed to a mysterious freezing
affliction after returning laden with treasures from Eiselcross. This
chilling illness, marked by creeping blue veins and an unshakeable
internal frost, has halted all expeditions north. Elro, a stoic elven
Glassblade tasked with protecting the village, implores the newcomers to
investigate, revealing that another villager, the reclusive trapper
Tulgi, suffers from the same malady.</p>
<p>Lodging is secured at the Jolly Dwarf tavern, courtesy of the jovial
proprietor Arl Bortock. Information is scarce, but Tulgi’s solitary
nature is noted. The adventurers proceed to Urgon’s ransacked cabin.
Amidst the disarray, Halite discovers a crucial receipt from Pelc’s
Curiosities, detailing Urgon’s sale of several Aeorian artifacts for a
thousand gold pieces: a dagger, scroll case, jade statue, quiver of
arrows, a jasper-set silver ring, and two blue glass vials containing a
fine powder. Tracks lead them to Tulgi’s cabin. Confronted, the
afflicted trapper confesses. She and her sister, Hulil, are criminals
from Shadycreek Run, hired to steal Aeorian artifacts. They raided
Urgon’s cabin; Hulil now possesses the remaining treasures and is hiding
in Croaker Cave, though Tulgi hasn’t seen her in weeks. She surrenders
Urgon’s dagger to Kragor.</p>
<p>Their investigation takes them to Pelc’s Curiosities, where they
interrupt a burglary in progress. Bandits, later revealed to be Hulil’s
underlings, are tearing the shop apart. From the rooftop, the observant
Doctor Pepe watches the unfolding chaos. A fierce battle erupts within
the shop, complicated by Scarlet casting a dense fog cloud. Kragor fells
one bandit in the mist, while Halite skewers another. Whisper confronts
the rooftop observer, grappling him awkwardly before shoving him to the
ground, where he feigns injury before slipping away. Elara heals the
wounded Kragor and inspires Halite, who dispatches another bandit. The
remaining two surrender, confirming they work for Hulil, a priestess of
Tiamat now suffering from the same freezing sickness. She sent them to
find clues about a cure, believing Pelc’s shop might hold answers. They
reveal Hulil has the artifacts in Croaker Cave. The party also makes the
grim discovery of Verla Pelc, the shop owner, frozen dead in her bed.
Searching the bandits yields meager coin and a peculiar Scanlan
Shorthalt t-shirt, which Elara deems potentially valuable.</p>
<p>Before venturing to Croaker Cave, the party visits Gramini, an
elderly elf potion seller at the docks. They negotiate the purchase of
healing potions, partially funding the transaction by trading the
Scanlan Shorthalt shirt, much to Gramini’s nostalgic delight. As they
approach the cave, the mysterious rogue reappears, introducing himself
as Doctor Pepe and offering his assistance, claiming a shared interest
in the disease. Inside Croaker Cave, they face immediate peril from
giant ice frogs lurking in a murky pool, one managing to severely wound
Whisper. Reinforcements arrive in the form of more bandits loyal to
Hulil, positioned across the water. A chaotic battle ensues, involving
crossbow fire, javelins, eldritch blasts, and divine magic. The party
prevails, capturing one dwarf bandit who reveals Hulil uses the frogs
for transport and has trained a particularly large one, “Old Croaker,”
to ferry people across a deeper underground lake. He also warns of a pit
trap near their sleeping quarters.</p>
<p>Using the captured dwarf’s knowledge and bat carcasses found nearby
as bait, the party crosses the underground lake astride Old Croaker. On
the far side, they confront Hulil, her skin marred by the blue streaks
of the affliction, and her last remaining follower. Another intense
fight concludes with Hulil’s defeat, her final words a chilling curse
upon Halite. They find a chest containing the stolen Aeorian artifacts
listed on Urgon’s receipt— all except the two blue glass vials. Hulil’s
journal reveals she sold one cracked vial to a traveling bookseller
named Irven Liel, hoping to fund her search for a cure.</p>
<p>Returning to Palebank Village, they encounter Elro again. After
hearing the adventurers’ story, he is able to identify the disease as
“Frigid Woe,” an ancient Aeorian magical contagion. Crucially, he
reveals a cure exists: a milky white liquid stored in golden vials,
likely found near the source of the blue vials. Elro pays the party for
dealing with Hulil and hires them to travel to Eiselcross, find the
cure, and send it back via a contact in the outpost of Syrinlya known as
“The Buyer”. He also offers a substantial reward for the remaining blue
vial.</p>
<p>The party tracks down Irven Liel at the Jolly Dwarf. He is traveling
with his husband Fenton and their twin tiefling daughters. Irven admits
to buying the cracked blue vial from Hulil as an investment. Scarlet
confirms it contains the Frigid Woe contagion. The party warns the
family they may be infected and secures the vial, receiving Elro’s
promised payment. Before departing, they visit Westeroff, a retired
wizard who identifies the dagger as magical but offers little else.
Halite purchases an arcane crystal focus from him.</p>
<p>Prior to the voyage, each party member undergoes subtle growth: Elara
hones her persuasive magic and performance, Whisper enhances her agility
and resilience, Scarlet deepens her bond with nature (gaining an owl
familiar, Sparky), Halite sharpens his tactical mind and culinary
skills, Kragor unlocks new eldritch power, and Doctor Pepe refines his
stealth and dexterity.</p>
<p>The adventurers board the <em>Remorhaz</em>, captained by the
seasoned Jarl Stonebeard, bound for Syrinlya. Once at sea, Stonebeard
drops his deferential act, running a pragmatic ship where all must
contribute. Kragor hauls up an ancient anchor from the legendary
privateer ship, the <em>Snowy Plover</em>. Whisper assists with rigging,
Scarlet and Halite learn cooking from the gruff chef Ingrid, Kragor
discovers a knack for filleting fish, and Doctor Pepe proves an adept
fisherman. Ingrid, recognizing talent, gifts cooking utensils to Kragor,
Halite, and Doctor Pepe. Evenings bring camaraderie through card games
and Elara’s enchanting musical performances.</p>
<p>A disturbance erupts one night: a winter wolf is found in the galley.
Kragor spots Ingrid’s distinctive moon-and-rune amulet discarded nearby.
After Whisper is injured attempting to retrieve it, Halite nets the
beast, and Elara manages to place the amulet around its neck. The wolf
transforms back into Chef Ingrid, revealing her lycanthropy, a secret
seemingly unknown to Captain Stonebeard, who orders everyone away while
confronting her privately.</p>
<p>Their journey continues into thick fog. The ship comes across
wreckage in the gloom, and the crew spots survivors clinging to debris
while a giant squid attacks them. The party, alongside the crew and the
rescued survivors— Gerhard (former captain of the lost ship
<em>Frostfang</em>), his young crewman Rorik, and a passenger, Bret (a
wizard revealed to be of the Cerberus Assembly)— fight off the colossal
creature. Bret demands passage to Icehaven, but Stonebeard refuses to
deviate from his course to Syrinlya.</p>
<p>Finally, after four days at sea, the fog lifts, revealing the
desolate, frozen shores of Eiselcross. The <em>Remorhaz</em> docks at
Syrinlya, a rough outpost of yurts huddled against the biting wind. They
are met by Morgo Delwur, a local guide who directs them to find Orvo
Mustave, Urgon’s former adventuring companion, and provides them lodging
in an abandoned, well-appointed yurt. Inside, they find supplies left by
the previous occupant, including rations, rope, a pickaxe, and a copy of
Scanlan Shorthalt’s <em>Adventure Sexy</em>.</p>
<p>They locate Orvo, who is devastated to learn of Urgon’s fate. He
confirms they found the blue vials at a ruin called Salsvault, roughly
an eight-day trek northwest across treacherous ice fields known as the
Thin Sheets. He warns them of Ice Mephits and animated armor guarding
the ruin, admitting they fled after encountering the constructs in the
third chamber. Of the golden vials, he knew nothing. For supplies, Orvo
directs them to Javel, an ancient dwarf trader. The party negotiates
with the eccentric Javel, acquiring seven pairs of snowshoes (including
a pair ominously stained red, hinted to be from a Yeti victim) and
climbing hammers, sealing the deal partly through a shared appreciation
for the raunchy novel <em>Tusk Love</em> (which Elara trades for a
discount) and receiving a bottle of Sandkeg’s High whiskey as a parting
gift. Equipped and informed, the adventurers brace themselves in their
borrowed yurt, planning their perilous overland journey to Salsvault in
search of the cure for the Frigid Woe.</p>
