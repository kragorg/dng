# Welcome to Palebank Village

<span class="dropcap">In the frosty expanse of the</span> colder reaches of Wildemount, in the Greying Wildlands south of the Islands of Eiselcross, lay the haphazard cluster known as Palebank Village. It was a place more cobbled together than planned, with just over a hundred cabins and shacks pressed against the northern cliffs that rose a mere fifteen feet against the lapping rhythms of the icy harbor waves. The docks, busy with the absence of departing ships, whispered tales of neglect and wariness.

On this frigid day, the village was subdued, gathered in mournful procession for the unfortunate Urgon, a dwarven adventurer whose final journey was to the graveyard west of the harbor. There, encased in a casket more suitable for a relic than a beloved friend, he lay suspended in a state of frozen eternity. Villagers whispered tales of his return from a year-long venture into Eiselcross, burdened with treasures and a chilling affliction. Despite countless efforts, Urgon could never find warmth. Eventually, blue streaks marred his pallor, snaking through his veins, until his entire being succumbed to the grip of frost.

We followed the procession, taking note of the landscape dotted with quaint inns and supply shops. Amongst the mourners stood a weathered elf adorned with the insignia of a “Glassblade”. Introducing himself as Elro, he shared that the usual voyages to Aeor had ceased; a silent testament to the mystery shrouding Urgon’s demise. Elro sought our help in unveiling the source of this insidious curse, admitting that Urgon’s home remained unexplored.

Word reached us quickly that another villager named Tulgi was showing similar symptoms—her fate seemingly entwined with Urgon’s. Fortuitously, their cabins stood in proximity.

## Beer with the Locals

In the heart of the village, a jovial dwarf Bortock tended bar at the local tavern. Elara, ever inquisitive, engaged Bortock in conversation about Urgon’s recent exploits. A night’s rest was negotiated—two rooms for eight silver pieces—before being served beer by the bucket and a meal of squid rolls.

Bill, a stalwart Glassblade at one of the tavern tables, emphasized that due to the danger of the curse, all boats were being warned off from Palebank’s docks. Meanwhile, we learned Tulgi was a solitary trapper, her life a mystery to most.

## The Cabins of Urgon and Tulgi

With this knowledge, we ventured to Urgon’s cabin where another Glass Blade vigilantly stood post. Halite led us inside, where chaos had left its mark. The mounted head of a snowy beast with grey horns seemed to have overseen the search. Books were strewn about, gear tossed aside as if someone had been desperately seeking something. Scarlet’s keen eyes caught sight of a grappling hook, swiftly claiming it. Meanwhile, with a sharp mind for details, Halite, discovered a receipt within a book. Dated two months prior, it recorded the sale of Aeorian items at the local Pelc’s Curiosities for a handsome sum of one thousand gold pieces. Among the items: a dagger, a scroll case, a jade statue, a quiver of arrows, a jasper-set silver ring, and two blue glass vials.

Our eyes traced tracks leading to Tulgi Lutan’s snow-burdened cabin. The warmth of a fierce fire belied the untouched exterior and shuttered windows. Scarlet’s knock brought a curt response, followed by Elara’s soft words which coaxed the door open. Tulgi’s face, marked by the same blue streaks that had doomed Urgon, was a testament to her shared affliction. She admitted her illness, confessing she and her sister Hulil, newcomers from Shady Creek Run, were in league with a crime syndicate. They had been sent to pilfer Aeorian treasures. It was they who had ransacked Urgon’s home, and Tulgi who now surrendered a finely wrought dagger into Kragor’s keeping.

She said that her sister Hulil held the remainder of the treasures in Croaker Cave, though Tulgi hadn’t seen her in weeks.

## Onward

With our next destination clear, we hiked to Pelc’s Curiosities. We found the shop marked by a dragon-gilded "P" where the front door sagged invitingly open, beckoning us into the next chapter of this unfolding tale.
