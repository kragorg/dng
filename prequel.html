<h1 id="prequel">Prequel</h1>
<p><span class="dropcap">The salt spray stings your faces</span> as the
longship grinds against the icy pier of Palebank Village. The groan of
splintering ice mixes with the cries of gulls and the shouts of
dockworkers bundled in furs. Palebank Village greets you with a blast of
frigid air, a stark contrast to the relative warmth of the southern seas
you’ve left behind. The sky above is a perpetual gray, heavy with the
promise of more snow.</p>
<p>You’ve endured weeks at sea, braving treacherous currents and icy
squalls aboard the <em>Frostwind</em>, a sturdy, if somewhat cramped,
longship captained by a weathered and taciturn dwarf. The journey itself
proved more than just a test of sea legs; it was during those long,
monotonous days and nights that your paths first crossed. Over shared
meals of salted fish and hardtack, huddled around the meager warmth of
the ship’s brazier, you discovered a shared purpose beneath your
disparate backgrounds. Perhaps it was a whispered conversation overheard
in the galley, a chance encounter on deck under the pale moonlight, or a
late-night debate in the cramped crew quarters, but you each realized
you were drawn north by the same alluring whispers: the rediscovery of
Aeorian ruins, remnants of a lost civilization swallowed by the
Frostfell. Tales of lost cities and powerful artifacts have spread like
wildfire, carried on the winds and traded in taverns from the Menagerie
Coast to the shores of Wildemount. These stories have lured explorers,
scholars, and fortune-seekers alike to this desolate land, and fate, or
perhaps something more, has brought you together on this shared
voyage.</p>
<p>Palebank Village, a ramshackle collection of wooden buildings huddled
against the harsh landscape, serves as the primary gateway to the frozen
Islands of Eiselcross to the North. Here, amidst the bustle of fur
traders, fisherfolk, grizzled explorers, shady mercenaries, and hopeful
fortune-seekers, you disembark. The air is thick with anticipation, a
palpable sense of excitement mixed with a healthy dose of apprehension.
The promise of uncovering lost knowledge, powerful magic, and perhaps
even unimaginable wealth hangs heavy in the air, a beacon in this frozen
wilderness. But the frozen shores of Eiselcross hold many secrets, and
the ruins of Aeor are guarded by more than just ice and snow. Ancient
dangers stir beneath the frozen surface, and the secrets you seek may
come at a terrible price. Your journey into the heart of Eiselcross
begins now, the moment your boots touch the frozen ground.</p>
