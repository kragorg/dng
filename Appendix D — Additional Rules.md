Adventuring is a hard life. With a cook along on the journey, your meals will be much better than the typical mix of hardtack and dried fruit.

**Components.** Cook’s utensils include a metal pot, knives, forks, a stirring spoon, and a ladle.

**History.** Your knowledge of cooking techniques allows you to assess the social patterns involved in a culture’s eating habits.

**Medicine.** When administering treatment, you can transform medicine that is bitter or sour into a pleasing concoction.

**Survival.** When foraging for food, you can make do with ingredients you scavenge that others would be unable to transform into nourishing meals.

**Prepare Meals.** As part of a short rest, you can prepare a tasty meal that helps your companions regain their strength. You and up to five creatures of your choice regain 1 extra hit point per Hit Die spent during a short rest, provided you have access to your cook’s utensils and sufficient food.
