<h1 id="scarlet-tanager">Scarlet Tanager</h1>
<p><span class="dropcap">Scarlet Tanager grew up</span> tangled in
brambles and birdcalls, raised more by moss and moonlight than by
halfling hearths. Her early days were wild — tracking foxes through the
fog, mimicking bird whistles, and napping on sun-warmed roots with her
owl companion Sparky perched nearby.</p>
<p>From the forest, she learned healing — which roots soothed pain,
which fungus cured rot, which songs calmed frightened deer. But she also
studied: sketching leaves in a threadbare notebook, tracking lunar
cycles, deciphering glyphs etched in ancient bark.</p>
<p>The spirits of the land spoke to her. Not always in words, but in
wind patterns and animal eyes. When she first called one forth — a
shimmering elk that lingered only long enough to chase away a pack of
wolves — she knew she was not just a druid. She was a Shepherd.</p>
<p>She’s not without flaws. Scarlet’s curiosity sometimes outweighs her
caution. Her fingers tend to “borrow” interesting things, and while she
trusts nature implicitly, she has a harder time trusting people. But she
protects the wild and its creatures fiercely — and now, in Eiselcross,
where magic runs old and thin beneath the ice, she listens for the
voices only she can hear.</p>
