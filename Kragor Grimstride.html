<h1 id="kragor-grimstride">Kragor Grimstride</h1>
<p>I am Kragor Grimstride, orphan of Bladegarden. My parents were proud
orcs of the Righteous Brand who gave their lives defending their city.
Or, so I was told, although I have also heard whispers of betrayals.
Either way, I was left a homeless orphan at the age of five. Though I
long to discover the truth about my parents, my life has consisted of
little more than the struggle to survive.</p>
<p>I was weaker and dumber than the tyrannical bullies who ruled the
streets. By deception, speed, stealth, and a silver tongue I survived
until adulthood. I don’t know why… maybe merely by chance… some
presence… some thing… from outside our realm took an interest in me and
began whispering in my dreams— words and images that I could not
understand. For months these dreams plagued me, until my darkest hour.
One night I was caught unawares by a gang of thugs. I struggled to fend
them off but was brought close to death. Feeble and desperate, despising
my own weakness, my will to live was as strong as ever. I screamed into
the void and surrendered to whatever it was that had been watching me.
It filled me with power and I overcame the attackers, killing some and
routing the others.</p>
<p>Since then dream visions have continued to haunt my slumber and
reveal the depth of my awakened abilities. With my war hammer raised and
eldritch energy crackling at my fingertips, I have fought against the
tyrants at every opportunity, protecting those they sought to
exploit.</p>
<p>Gradually, my dreams began to make some sense— as a command and as a
promise for greater power. “Go north. Cross the frozen north. To
Eiselcross.” The purpose remained veiled, but my resolve was absolute. I
would follow.</p>
<p>I traveled six weeks winding through Bladegarden, Hupperdook,
Nogvugrot, and Yrrosa, until Icehaven emerged from the frost. A
Righteous Brand veteran now seeking his own fortune was a tale that
opened purses and secured passage. Merchants, traders, wandering groups
paid for my protection, though my true purpose was survival. Traveling
alone meant certain death. Joining caravans and groups was a matter of
strategic necessity.</p>
<p>Dangerous encounters were rare, but not nonexistent. Most challenges
I met with cunning and bluff, my war hammer a sufficient deterrent. But
when serious threats pressed— moments that demanded more than just
smashing some heads— I would resort to my eldritch powers, breaking the
careful illusion of a simple veteran soldier. Sometimes those who
witnessed this would withdraw, recognizing I was something else
entirely, leaving me to continue my calculated journey north on my
own.</p>
<p>Once I reached Icehaven I made bargain with the first captain who
would take me. The rest you know as we all met on board the
<em>Frostwind</em> on our way to Palebank Village.</p>
