<h1 id="kragor-grimstride">Kragor Grimstride</h1>
<p><span class="dropcap">I am Kragor Grimstride, orphan</span> of
Bladegarden. My parents were proud orcs of the Righteous Brand, fallen
heroes who died defending our city’s walls. But hushed whispers in the
alleys hinted at a darker truth— betrayal, or sacrifices made in
shadows. At five years old, none of that mattered. Only the gnawing
emptiness of my belly and the cold stone streets that became my
home.</p>
<p>I was never as strong or clever as the tyrannical bullies who ruled
the streets. By deception, speed, stealth, and a silver tongue I
survived until adulthood. Fortunately, I was lucky enough to be taken
under the wing by a grizzled, retired veteran who had learned the art of
tattooing while on tour near Xhorhas. He taught me the skill, and I
scrapped together a few coppers as an apprentice. But my designs… they
were never truly my own. Sometimes I would take up the needle, and my
hands would move with a will I did not recognize, etching abstract,
strange, and unsettling glyphs. Other than myself, they interested only
a few mages, those who saw something beyond the ink on skin, something
that mirrored the unsettling stirrings already taking root in my own
mind. My mentor, Dagmuk, who taught me how to manifest these designs on
my skin and others’, often said I had a “touch for the unseen.” He
couldn’t have known how literal that would become.</p>
<p>Even as I navigated the tangible threats of Bladegarden and the daily
grind of survival, a far more insidious struggle began to unfold in the
dark expanse of my unconscious mind. I don’t know why, or how, but some
presence… some thing… from outside our realm began whispering in my
dreams— discordant, incomprehensible words, and images of impossible
geometries. For months these dreams plagued me, a subtle, creeping
insinuation into the corners of my mind. The murmurs were vague at
first, then became persistent, a distant echo of a vast, alien hunger
stirring far beyond my comprehension.</p>
<p>My darkest hour arrived one night. After earning a decent sum from
tattooing a wizard, I boasted about my newfound wealth, unaware that
Brother Theron and his Tuskbreakers were watching. These thugs had
terrorized downtrodden orcs like me for years. I was caught off guard
and struggled to fend them off, but the blows rained down, each one a
hammer against my fading strength. Blood filled my mouth. The world
tilted into darkness. Feeble and desperate, despising the weakness that
had always plagued me, my will to live burned hotter than ever. Then the
whispers exploded into a roar inside my skull— an ancient will offering
power beyond imagining. I screamed and I surrendered. Eldritch energy
surged through my veins; my eyes bled black. The tattooed glyphs on my
arms burned with a cold light. Muscles tensed unnaturally; power
crackled at my fingertips. I didn’t just fight back—I unleashed a storm.
I obliterated one of the thugs and sent the others scattering into the
night, their screams echoing my own.</p>

<p>Since then dream visions continued to haunt my slumber and reveal the
depth of my awakened abilities. With my war hammer raised and eldritch
energy crackling at my fingertips, I fought against the street tyrants
at every opportunity, protecting those they sought to exploit.</p>
<p>Gradually, the chaos of my dreams began to coalesce into a chilling
clarity— a command, stark and undeniable, and a promise of greater
power. “Go north. Cross the frozen north. To Eiselcross.” The purpose
remained a shrouded mystery, yet a strange, cold resolve settled deep
within me. I would follow.</p>
<p>When I went to give Dagmuk my farewell, he was gone and his shop was
empty, abandoned. His tools were scattered like forgotten memories. A
scorched parchment bore one of my glyphs. An unspoken message? A
warning? I felt a pang of loss for the only person who believed in
me.</p>
<p>I hit the road with a cover story. A Righteous Brand veteran now
seeking his own fortune was a tale that opened purses and secured
passage. Merchants, traders, wandering groups paid for my protection,
though my true purpose was survival. Traveling alone meant certain
death. Joining caravans and groups was a matter of strategic
necessity.</p>
<p>Nights were the hardest— when the cold bit through my cloak and the
whispers in my mind grew louder, reminding me I was no mere soldier.
Dangerous encounters were rare, but not nonexistent. Most challenges I
met with a growl and a bluff, my war hammer a sufficient deterrent. But
there were moments when mere brute force wouldn’t suffice— moments when
I felt the cold breath of death on my neck. It was then, when my
instincts screamed that head-smashing is not enough, I would unleash the
alien power within me, breaking the careful illusion of a simple veteran
soldier. The reactions were always the same: a mix of shock, fear, and a
quick retreat as they recognized I was something else entirely. They
would scatter, leaving me to continue my calculated journey, the
whispers in my mind a constant companion.</p>
<p>Six weeks of winding roads and vicious winds carried me through
Bladegarden, Hupperdook, Nogvugrot, and Yrrosa. Icehaven finally emerged
from the Zemni Fields like a promise. Once I arrived, I made bargain
with the first captain who would take me. The rest you know, as we all
met on board the <em>Frostwind</em> on our way to Palebank Village.</p>
