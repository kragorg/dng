<h1 id="kragor-grimstride">Kragor Grimstride</h1>
<p><span class="dropcap">I am Kragor Grimstride, orphan</span> of
Bladegarden. My parents were proud orcs of the Righteous Brand, fallen
heroes who died defending our city’s walls. But hushed whispers in the
alleys hinted at a darker truth— betrayal, or sacrifices made in
shadows. At five years old, none of that mattered. Only the gnawing
emptiness of my belly and the cold stone streets that became my
home.</p>
<p>I was never as strong or clever as the tyrannical bullies who ruled
the streets. By deception, speed, stealth, and a silver tongue I
survived until adulthood. Fortunately, I was lucky enough to be taken
under the wing by a grizzled, retired veteran who had learned the art of
tattooing while on tour near Xhorhas. He taught me the skill, and I
scrapped together a few coppers as an apprentice. But my designs… they
were never truly my own. Sometimes I would take up the needle, and my
hands would move with a will I did not recognize, etching abstract,
strange, and unsettling glyphs. Other than myself, they interested only
a few mages, those who saw something beyond the ink on skin, something
that mirrored the unsettling stirrings already taking root in my own
mind. My mentor, Dagmuk, who taught me how to manifest these designs on
my skin and others’, often said I had a “touch for the unseen.” He
couldn’t have known how literal that would become.</p>
<p>Even as I navigated the tangible threats of Bladegarden and the daily
grind of survival, a far more insidious struggle began to unfold in the
dark expanse of my unconscious mind. I don’t know why, or how, but some
presence… some thing… from outside our realm began whispering in my
dreams— discordant, incomprehensible words, and images of impossible
geometries. For months these dreams plagued me, a subtle, creeping
insinuation into the corners of my mind. The murmurs were vague at
first, then became persistent, a distant echo of a vast, alien hunger
stirring far beyond my comprehension.</p>
<p>My darkest hour arrived one night. After earning a decent sum from
tattooing a wizard, I boasted about my newfound wealth, unaware that
Brother Theron and his Tuskbreakers were watching. These thugs had
terrorized downtrodden orcs like me for years. I was caught off guard
and struggled to fend them off, but the blows rained down, each one a
hammer against my fading strength. Blood filled my mouth. The world
tilted into darkness. Feeble and desperate, despising the weakness that
had always plagued me, my will to live burned hotter than ever. Then the
whispers exploded into a roar inside my skull— an ancient will offering
power beyond imagining. I screamed and I surrendered. Eldritch energy
surged through my veins; my eyes bled black. The tattooed glyphs on my
arms burned with a cold light. Muscles tensed unnaturally; power
crackled at my fingertips. I didn’t just fight back—I unleashed a storm.
I obliterated one of the thugs and sent the others scattering into the
night, their screams echoing my own.</p>
<p><img src="kragor-awakens.jpg" /></p>
<p>Since then dream visions continued to haunt my slumber and reveal the
depth of my awakened abilities. With my war hammer raised and eldritch
energy crackling at my fingertips, I fought against the street tyrants
at every opportunity, protecting those they sought to exploit.</p>
<p>Gradually, the chaos of my dreams began to coalesce into a chilling
clarity— a command, stark and undeniable, and a promise of greater
power. “Go north. Cross the frozen north. To Eiselcross.” The purpose
remained a shrouded mystery, yet a strange, cold resolve settled deep
within me. I would follow.</p>
<p>When I went to give Dagmuk my farewell, he was gone and his shop was
empty, abandoned. His tools were scattered like forgotten memories. A
scorched parchment bore one of my glyphs. An unspoken message? A
warning? I felt a pang of loss for the only person who believed in
me.</p>
<p>I hit the road with a cover story. A Righteous Brand veteran now
seeking his own fortune was a tale that opened purses and secured
passage. Merchants, traders, wandering groups paid for my protection,
though my true purpose was survival. Traveling alone meant certain
death. Joining caravans and groups was a matter of strategic
necessity.</p>
<p>Nights were the hardest— when the cold bit through my cloak and the
whispers in my mind grew louder, reminding me I was no mere soldier.
Dangerous encounters were rare, but not nonexistent. Most challenges I
met with a growl and a bluff, my war hammer a sufficient deterrent. But
there were moments when mere brute force wouldn’t suffice— moments when
I felt the cold breath of death on my neck. It was then, when my
instincts screamed that head-smashing is not enough, I would unleash the
alien power within me, breaking the careful illusion of a simple veteran
soldier. The reactions were always the same: a mix of shock, fear, and a
quick retreat as they recognized I was something else entirely. They
would scatter, leaving me to continue my calculated journey, the
whispers in my mind a constant companion.</p>
<p>Four weeks of winding roads and vicious winds carried me from
Bladegarden, through Nogvugrot, Rexxentrum, and Yrrosa. Icehaven finally
emerged from the Zemni Fields like a promise. Once I arrived, I made
bargain with the first captain who would take me. The rest you know, as
we all met on board the <em>Frostwind</em> on our way to Palebank
Village.</p>
<h2 id="appearance">Appearance</h2>
<p><em>From the journal of a traveler, name unknown, recovered from a
windswept road north of Saltwallow Bog:</em></p>
<p>Of all the strange and disquieting souls one is fated to meet upon
the winding roads of this world, few have etched themselves into my
memory with such unnerving clarity as this singular orc. To look upon
him is to read a page torn from two different books, one a
gutter-dweller’s grimy chapbook, the other a tome bound in the skin of
something that fell from the stars.</p>
<p>He calls himself Kragor Grimstride, a name that tastes of iron and
long marches, and he wears the part with a practiced ease. The bearing
of a soldier is there, in the straightness of his spine and the way his
hand rests near the haft of a war hammer that seems, upon closer
inspection, a trifle too heavy for him. He is an orc, yes— the mottled,
greenish-gray skin, the dark architecture of his bones, the twin tusks
jutting like broken daggers from his lower lip all attest to that. He
wore no mustache, but thick sideburns descended to a dark beard that
framed a jaw of resolute strength. He is a tower of a man, tall enough
to cast a long shadow even in this wan light.</p>
<p>Yet, the illusion of the common sell-sword frays at the edges. Where
one expects a bulwark of muscle, a physique hewn from granite, there is
instead a certain wiry tension. He lacks the brutish mass of his kin; he
is built not like a battering ram, but like a coiled whip, all lean
sinew and a predator’s deceptive grace. His strength is not in the
breadth of his shoulders, but in the quick, assessing flick of his gaze
and the low, persuasive timbre of his voice. He has survived not by
breaking skulls, but by turning heads and twisting words— a truth that
clings to him more closely than the worn leather of his armor.</p>
<p>His face is a study in contradictions. The long, jet-black hair,
drawn back in a severe topknot, speaks of discipline. But his eyes… his
eyes are where the true madness begins to leak through. They are not the
simple, brutish black or bloodshot red of his race. They are the color
of a winter sea beneath a sky of impossible clarity, a startling
aquamarine. And within that startling blue, flecks of gold drift like
motes of dust in a sunbeam— or, if one stares too long, like the
shattered script of some forgotten, cosmic alphabet. There is an
unnerving depth there, a sense that one is not looking <em>at</em> his
eyes, but <em>through</em> them, into a gulf of chilling, silent
space.</p>
<p>And then, there are the tattoos.</p>
<p>They are not the proud clan-marks or crude battle-scrawls of a
typical orc warrior. These are things of a different order entirely.
They coil around his arms and spill across his collarbones, a filigree
of stark black ink upon gray-green skin. At a glance, they might seem
abstract, but to the discerning eye— or to the mind already teetering on
the edge of certain esoteric truths— they are a disease made manifest in
ink. They are a brand of unhallowed calligraphy.</p>
<p>There are no dragons, no skulls, no symbols of martial pride. There
are only glyphs of a maddening, alien geometry. Spirals that seem to
pull the eye into a lightless void. Angles that meet in ways that make
the head ache. Lines that weave into patterns that suggest the skeletal
framework of things that should not exist. They are not merely on his
skin; they seem a part of it, and in the shifting light of the campfire,
they sometimes appear to writhe, to shift their configuration ever so
slightly when you are not looking directly at them. They whisper of a
pact made not in blood, but in the currency of sanity itself.</p>
<p>He stands there, a charlatan of the mundane, his simple story a
threadbare cloak thrown over a form scribbled with the signature of a
lunatic god. He is an orphan, a veteran, a survivor. But he is also a
vessel, a canvas for an artist whose studio is the void between worlds.
One looks at Kragor Grimstride and sees a down-on-his-luck orc seeking
his fortune, but one also feels an inexplicable chill, the same disquiet
one feels when hearing a melody that is almost beautiful, but for a
single, recurring, discordant note that promises only chaos and the
dark.</p>

<h2 id="philosophy">Philosophy</h2>
<p>For Kragor Grimstride, faith is not a whispered prayer in a
sanctioned temple; it is a pragmatic code forged in the shadow of his
parents’ dual legacies and hammered into shape on the unforgiving anvil
of the streets. Having been orphaned and left to fend for himself after
their mysterious end, Kragor is a survivor first and foremost. He views
the divine not as beings demanding worship, but as philosophies to be
utilized— a collection of tools for navigating a broken world. His True
Neutral alignment is born from this harsh education, for his life has
taught him the equal utility of both law and chaos. He doesn’t believe
in gods; he believes in results.</p>
<p>This philosophy is anchored by a fierce opposition to tyranny, a
principle inherited from the profound contradictions of his family’s
life. Both his parents were decorated veterans of the Righteous Brand.
His father honored Bahamut with the straightforward piety of a loyal
soldier, instilling in Kragor a respect for the Platinum Dragon as the
symbol of his family’s noble purpose: be the bulwark for the vulnerable,
bring justice where there is none, and act with honor. Kragor witnessed
the opposite in the alleys of Bladegarden— the strong preying on the
weak— and clings to the ideal of protection his parents fought for. A
silent nod to a carving of the Platinum Dragon on a barracks wall is not
an act of worship, but a solemn vow to memory of his parents.</p>
<p>Yet, Kragor has no patience for the rigid laws and hierarchies of the
Empire that ultimately failed to protect him. This defiant streak was
nurtured by his mother. A decorated soldier herself, she walked a more
dangerous path, secretly revering Kord within an underground community.
From her, Kragor learned the core tenets of the Storm Lord: the
necessity of personal might and the virtue of self-reliance. His
mother’s faith, forbidden by the Empire, represented the untamed orcish
spirit— a chaotic but vital force required to break the chains of
oppression. It taught him from his earliest days that true strength
often operates outside the sanction of the law. After being orphaned and
thrust onto the merciless streets, he grasped this truth in his
bones.</p>
<p>This upbringing placed Kragor at the center of a fundamental
conflict. The Empire was the institution that gave his parents
prosperity and a noble cause, yet it was also the tyrant that forced his
mother’s faith into the shadows, and let him fall through the cracks.
This hypocrisy fuels his entire worldview. He despises bullies and
oppressive systems not from abstract principle, but because he was
raised by a family forced to navigate the hypocrisy of one every single
day.</p>
<p>His warlock pact is the ultimate and most logical expression of this
philosophy. When he needed power to survive and to fight back, he didn’t
turn to prayer— not to his father’s sanctioned god nor his mother’s
forbidden one. He made a deal. He weclomed a patron who could provide
him with tangible tools— pact magic and eldritch invocations— to achieve
his goals. Bahamut and Kord are not gods to be worshipped, but names for
the two essential instruments he inherited and now wields to enforce his
code: the righteous conviction that bullies need crushing, backed by the
power and will to be the hammer.</p>
