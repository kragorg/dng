<h3 class="item" id="adventure-sexy">Adventure Sexy</h3>
<p><span class="item-type"><em>Book, uncommon</em></span></p>
<p>Penned by the illustrious, if not always entirely humble, bard
Scanlan Shorthalt, this exquisite leather-bound tome with its full title
“Adventure Sexy: Impress Potential Lovers with Great Deeds” emblazoned
in glittering gold leaf is less a guide to genuine heroism and more a
compendium of dramatically (and often exaggerated) retold exploits,
carefully curated for maximum romantic appeal.</p>
<p>While it contains questionable advice on actual adventuring,
“Adventure Sexy” is filled with Scanlan’s unique brand of bravado, wit,
and selective memory, offering numerous examples of how to creatively
present one’s deeds to potential romantic interests. It’s more a
testament to Scanlan’s ego and showmanship than a source of arcane
power.</p>
<h3 class="item" id="dagger">Aeorian Dagger, +1</h3>
<p><span class="item-type"><em>Weapon, uncommon</em></span></p>
<p>A finely wrought dagger previously sold to Pelc’s Curiosities,
pilfered by Tulgi Lutan, and surrendered by same to Kragor Grimstride.
With the rest of the party’s blessing, Kragor ultimately gifted the
dagger to Doctor Pepe.</p>
<p>You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic
weapon.</p>
<p>This weapon has the following mastery property. To use this property,
you must have a feature that lets you use it.</p>
<p><strong>Nick.</strong> When you make the extra attack of the
<strong>Light</strong> property, you can make it as part of the Attack
action instead of as a Bonus Action. You can make this extra attack only
once per turn.</p>
<h3 class="item" id="robes">Aeorian Robes</h3>
<p><span class="item-type"><em>Gear, uncommon</em></span></p>
<p>Red robes in the style of Aeor. They are of a plant-like material and
perfectly preserved.</p>
<h3 class="item" id="arrows">Arrows, +1</h3>
<p><span class="item-type"><em>Weapon, uncommon</em></span></p>
<p>You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this piece
of magic ammunition. Once it hits a target, the ammunition is no longer
magical.</p>
<h3 class="item" id="whisky">Bald Dwarf Whisky</h3>
<p><span class="item-type"><em>Consumable, uncommon</em></span></p>
<p>An Uthodurnian specialty spirit, with an estimated value of 25
gp.</p>
<h3 class="item" id="aeorian-blue">Bottle of Aeorian Blue</h3>
<p><span class="item-type"><em>Consumable, uncommon</em></span></p>
<p>Corked bottle wrapped in a golden metal filigree, and adorned with
strange writing. Within the bottle, something blue and iridescent swirls
like a captured galaxy.</p>
<h3 class="item" id="scroll-case">Gilded Scroll Case</h3>
<p><span class="item-type"><em>Gear</em></span></p>
<p>A finely crafted mahogany container adorned with gold filigree and
inlaid gemstones, providing both beauty and protection for the scrolls
inside. It features runes that offer magical safeguarding against
damage, making it ideal for keeping valuable parchments secure.</p>
<h3 class="item" id="ice-hammer">Ice Hammer</h3>
<p><span class="item-type"><em>Gear</em></span></p>
<p>A specialized tool for navigating treacherous icy and snowy
environments, an ice hammer features a sharp pick on one side of its
head and a hammer on the other, mounted on a sturdy haft, with a looped
cord for securing to the wrist. It is primarily used for cutting into
ice to create handholds or anchor points, and for balance.</p>
<p><strong>Climbing.</strong> When you are climbing on ice or snow and
are using an ice hammer in one or both hands, you can use your reaction
when you would fall to attempt a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check to
stop your fall. On a success, your fall is arrested, and you remain
clinging to the surface.</p>
<p>An ice hammer provides advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks made
to climb surfaces of ice or packed snow that offer suitable purchase for
the pick.</p>
<p><strong>Ice breaking.</strong> An ice hammer can also be used to
break through thin ice. You can use an action to strike a surface of
ice. For every inch of ice thickness, this requires a successful DC 10
Strength check. On a success, you break through up to 1 inch of ice.</p>
<h3 class="item" id="statuette">Jade Statuette of a Storm Giant</h3>
<p><span class="item-type"><em>Miscellaneous</em></span></p>
<p>A meticulously carved figurine, standing approximately eight inches
tall, depicting a storm giant in mid-roar, with intricate details
capturing the raw power and majesty of its kind. The deep green jade
shimmers with veins of gold, suggesting latent magical energies, and
when held during a lightning storm, the statuette seems to vibrate
softly, as if resonating with the storm’s fury. Ancient runes inscribed
at the base suggest it could be used in rituals to commune with primal
forces of nature, potentially granting temporary insight or power
related to storms.</p>
<h3 class="item" id="ring">Silver Ring</h3>
<p><span class="item-type"><em>Jewelry</em></span></p>
<p>A silver ring with an inset jasper stone, valued at 50 gold
pieces.</p>
<h3 class="item" id="snowshoes">Snowshoes</h3>
<p><span class="item-type"><em>Gear</em></span></p>
<p>These sturdy snowshoes are constructed with a wooden frame, strung
with durable babiche (rawhide lacing) for the webbing. Animal hide
straps and bindings secure them firmly to your boots. The underside
features a series of sharp, durable metal spikes and edges (crampons) to
bite into icy surfaces. They are designed to withstand the harsh, cold
environment and provide reliable, non-magical assistance on the ice and
snow. They are specifically adapted for the varied and often treacherous
conditions of the Thin Sheets, though they require careful handling.</p>
<p><strong>Speed.</strong> While wearing these snowshoes, you ignore
difficult terrain caused by deep snow and non-slippery ice. Your speed
is reduced by 10 feet when not moving on ice or snow.</p>
<p><strong>Distributed weight.</strong> The snowshoes’ design helps to
distribute your weight slightly. When moving across thin ice, you gain a
+2 bonus to the DC of any check to see if the ice breaks under you.</p>
<h3 class="item" id="oil">Oil</h3>
<p><span class="item-type"><em>Gear</em></span></p>
<p>You can douse a creature, object, or space with Oil or use it as
fuel, as detailed below.</p>
<p><em>Dousing a Creature or an Object.</em> When you take the Attack
action, you can replace one of your attacks with throwing an Oil flask.
Target one creature or object within 20 feet of yourself. The target
must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw (DC 8 plus your Dexterity
modifier and Proficiency Bonus) or be covered in oil. If the target
takes Fire damage before the oil dries (after 1 minute), the target
takes an extra 5 Fire damage from burning oil.</p>
<p><em>Dousing a Space.</em> You can take the Utilize action to pour an
Oil flask on level ground to cover a 5-foot-square area within 5 feet of
yourself. If lit, the oil burns until the end of the turn 2 rounds from
when the oil was lit (or 12 seconds) and deals 5 Fire damage to any
creature that enters the area or ends its turn there. A creature can
take this damage only once per turn.</p>
<p><em>Fuel.</em> Oil serves as fuel for Lamps and Lanterns. Once lit, a
flask of Oil burns for 6 hours in a Lamp or Lantern. That duration
doesn’t need to be consecutive; you can extinguish the burning Oil (as a
Utilize action) and rekindle it again until it has burned for a total of
6 hours.</p>
<h3 class="item" id="journal">Hulil’s Journal</h3>
<p><span class="item-type"><em>Book, common</em></span></p>
<p>Hulil Lutan’s journal, mentioning that she sold a vial of blue powder
to Irven Liel.</p>
<h3 class="item" id="dragon-egg">White Dragon Egg</h3>
<p><span class="item-type"><em>Wondrous item, Rare</em></span></p>
<p>This ovoid object stands roughly 3 feet tall and weighs a hefty 50
pounds. It was discovered half-buried in a snowdrift on the frozen
tundra, a remnant of a long-gone dragon’s clutch.</p>
<p>The egg does not have a smooth shell. Instead, its surface is a
complex latticework of crystalline facets, like a massive, uncut diamond
sculpted from glacial ice. A permanent, supernatural rime coats its
exterior, making it painfully cold to the touch. In low light, a faint,
pale blue luminescence pulses rhythmically from deep within its core,
akin to a slowly beating heart. The air within 5 feet of the egg is
noticeably colder than the surrounding environment.</p>
<p><strong>Frigid Shell.</strong> The egg is immune to cold damage but
vulnerable to bludgeoning damage. Its shell has an Armor Class (AC) of
14 and 35 (6d10) hit points. A creature that touches the egg with its
bare skin for the first time on a turn or starts its turn in contact
with it takes 1d6 cold damage.</p>
<p><strong>Innate Magic.</strong> The egg radiates a faint aura of
Transmutation magic if scrutinized with a spell like <em>Detect
Magic</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Incubation.</strong> Scarlet’s evaluation of the egg is that
it is viable and will hatch in a few days or weeks. For the wyrmling to
develop properly, the egg must be kept in an environment at or below
freezing temperatures.</p>
