<h2>Hatching Dragon Eggs</h2>
<p>When a dragon egg finishes incubating, the wyrmling inside must break
out of the egg. If the parents are nearby, they often assist by gently
tapping on the eggshell. Otherwise, the wyrmling must break out on its
own, a process that usually takes no more than a minute or two once the
wyrmling begins trying to escape the egg. All the eggs in a clutch hatch
at about the same time.</p>
<p>Properly tended and incubated dragon eggs have practically a 100%
hatching rate. Eggs that have been disturbed, and particularly eggs that
have been removed from a nest and incubated artificially, may be much
less likely to produce live wyrmlings.</p>

<section id="incubating-dragon-eggs" class="level2">
<h2>Incubating Dragon Eggs</h2>
<p>Once laid, a dragon egg requires suitable incubation conditions if it
is to hatch. The embryonic wyrmling inside a dragon egg can survive
under inadequate incubation conditions, but not for long. An embryonic
wyrmling inside a dragon egg becomes sentient as it enters the final
quarter of the incubation period. Dragon egg incubation conditions are
as follows:</p>
<p><strong>White</strong>: The egg must be buried in snow, encased in
ice, or kept in a temperature below 0°F.</p>
</section>
<section id="wyrmling-age-0-5-years" class="level2">
<h2>Wyrmling (Age 0-5 Years)</h2>
<p>A wyrmling emerges from its egg fully formed and ready to face life.
From the tip of its nose to the end of its tail, it is about twice as
long as the egg that held it.</p>
<p>A newly hatched dragon emerges from its egg cramped and sodden. After
about an hour, it is ready to fly, fight, and reason. It inherits a
considerable body of practical knowledge from its parents, though such
inherent knowledge often lies buried in the wyrmling’s memory, unnoticed
and unused until it is needed.</p>
<p>Compared to older dragons, a wyrmling seems a little awkward. Its
head and feet seem slightly oversized, and its wings and tail are
proportionately smaller than they are in adults.</p>
<p>If a parent is present at the wyrmling’s hatching, the youngster has
a protector and will probably enjoy a secure existence for the first
decades of its life. If not, the wyrmling faces a struggle for
survival.</p>
<p>Whether raised by another dragon or left to fend for itself, the
wyrmling’s first order of business is learning to be a dragon, which
includes securing food, finding a lair, and understanding its own
abilities (usually in that order).</p>
<p>A newly hatched wyrmling almost immediately searches for food. The
first meal for a wyrmling left to fend for itself is often the shell
from its egg. This practice not only assures the youngster a good dose
of vital minerals, but also provides an alternative to attacking and
consuming its nestmates. Wyrmlings reared by parents are often offered
some tidbit that the variety favors. For example, copper dragons provide
their offspring with monstrous centipedes or scorpions. In many cases
this meal is in the form of living prey, and the wyrmling gets its first
hunting lesson along with its first meal.</p>
<p>With its hunger satisfied, the wyrmling’s next task is securing a
lair. The dragon looks for some hidden and defensible cave, nook, or
cranny where it can rest, hide, and begin storing treasure. Even a
wyrmling under the care of a parent finds a section of the parent’s lair
to call its own.</p>
<p>Once it feels secure in its lair and reasonably sure of its food
supply, the wyrmling settles down to hone its inherent abilities. It
usually does so by testing itself in any way it can. It tussles with its
nestmates, seeks out dangerous creatures to fight, and spends long hours
in meditation. If a parent is present, the wyrmling receives instruction
on draconic matters and the chance to accompany the parent during its
daily activities. Wyrmlings on their own sometimes seek out older
dragons of the same kind as mentors. Among good dragons, such
relationships tend to be casual and often last for decades (a fairly
short period by dragon standards). The youngster visits the older dragon
periodically (monthly, perhaps weekly) for advice and information. Evil
dragons, too, often counsel wyrmlings that are not their offspring—evil
dragons lack any sense of altruism, but usually understand the role of
youth in perpetuating the species. No matter what kinds of dragons are
involved, such mentor-apprentice relationships require the younger
dragon to show the utmost respect and deference to the older dragon, and
to bring the mentor gifts of food, information, and treasure. Should the
older dragon ever come to view the apprentice as a rival, the
relationship ends immediately; when evil dragons are involved, the
ending is often fatal for the younger dragon.</p>

<h2>Rearing a Dragon</h2>
<p>Being an adoptive parent to a dragon is no easy task. Even
good-aligned dragons have a sense of superiority and an innate yearning
for freedom. Most dragons instinctively defer to older dragons of the
same kind, but they tend to regard other creatures with some
disdain.</p>
<p>Older and wiser dragons eventually learn to respect non-dragons for
their abilities and accomplishments, but a newly hatched wyrmling tends
to regard a nondragon foster parent as a captor—or at best as a
well-meaning fool. Still, it is possible for a nondragon character to
forge a bond with a newly hatched wyrmling.</p>

<section id="dragons-and-languages" class="level2">
<h2>Dragons and Languages</h2>
<p>All dragons speak Draconic. With their high degree of intelligence,
most dragons have an affinity for language and speak additional
languages as well. Many even study the science of language, developing a
wide range of tongues.</p>

<section id="about-white-dragons" class="level2">
<h2>About White Dragons</h2>
<p>The smallest, least intelligent, and most animalistic of the true
dragons, white dragons prefer frigid climes—usually arctic areas, but
sometimes very high mountains, especially in winter. Mountain-dwelling
white dragons sometimes have conflicts with red dragons living nearby,
but the whites are wise enough to avoid the more powerful red dragons.
Red dragons tend to consider white dragons unworthy opponents and
usually are content to let a white dragon neighbor skulk out of sight
(and out of mind).</p>
<p>White dragons’ lairs are usually icy caves and deep subterranean
chambers that open away from the warming rays of the sun.
Dungeon-dwelling white dragons prefer cool areas and often lurk near
water, where they can hide and hunt.</p>
<p>A white dragon’s face expresses a hunter’s intense and single-minded
ferocity. A white dragon’s head has a sleek profile, with a small, sharp
beak at the nose and a pointed chin. A crest supported by a single
backward-curving spine tops the head. The dragon also has scaled cheeks,
spiny dewlaps, and a few protruding teeth when its mouth is closed.</p>
<p>When viewed from below, a white dragon shows a short neck and a
featureless head. Its wings appear blunted at the tips. The trailing
edge of the wing shows a pink or blue tinge, and the back edge of the
wing membrane joins the body near the back leg, at about mid-thigh.</p>
<p>The scales of a wyrmling white dragon glisten pure white. As the
dragon ages, the sheen disappears, and by very old age, scales of pale
blue and light gray are mixed in with the white.</p>
<p>A white dragon will consume only food that has been frozen. Usually a
white dragon devours a creature killed by its breath weapon while the
carcass is still stiff and frigid. It buries other kills in snowbanks
within or near its lair until they are suitably frozen. Finding such a
larder is a good indication that a white dragon lives nearby.</p>
<p>White dragons love the cold sheen and sparkle of ice, and they favor
treasure with similar qualities, particularly diamonds.</p>
<p>White dragons spurn the society of others of their kind, except for
members of the opposite sex. They are prone to carnal pleasures and
often mate just for the fun of it. They seldom tend their eggs, but they
often lay their eggs near their lairs, and one or both parents allow the
youngsters to move in for a time. The offspring are expected to care for
themselves, but they gain some measure of protection and education from
having their parents nearby.</p>
<p>It would be a mistake to consider a white dragon a stupid creature.
Older white dragons are at least as intelligent as humans, and even
younger ones are much smarter than predatory animals. Though not known
for their foresight, white dragons prove cunning when hunting or
defending their lairs and territories. White dragons know all the best
ambush spots for miles around their lairs, and they are clever enough to
pick out targets and concentrate attacks until one foe falls, then move
on to the next foe. White dragons prefer sudden assaults, swooping down
from aloft or bursting from beneath water, snow, or ice. They loose
their breath weapons, then try to knock out a single opponent with a
follow-up attack.</p>
<p>Although they are not pillars of intellect, white dragons have good
memories, especially for events they have witnessed or experienced
directly. They remember any slight or defeat and have been known to
conduct malicious vendettas against beings or groups that have offended
them.</p>
