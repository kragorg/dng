<h1 id="the-sunken-hall">The Sunken Hall</h1>
<p><span class="dropcap">The secret door, now open,</span> reveals a
narrow, stone-lined corridor stretching into darkness. From that
darkness, they shamble—two figures in robes the color of dried blood,
their movements a slow, palsied parody of a walk. Their skin is ancient
leather stretched over bone, their eyes hollow pits of shadow.</p>
<p>“Well,” Doctor Pepe mutters, his voice tight, “At least they’re
slow.” A little louder, he alerts the rest of the party: “We’ve got
zombies!”</p>
<p>Elara relays this in a sing-song voice to pass on the message:
“Zombie! Zombie! Zombie-ie-ie!”</p>
<p>Kragor, a green-gray juggernaut of righteous fury, needs no
encouragement. He barrels past Doctor Pepe into the hallway, his boots
thudding on the strange, seamless stone. He sees not two, but four of
the desiccated things lurching toward him. <em>“Mactē virtutē,”</em> he
snarls, and a shimmering shell of magical frost crackles into existence
around him. His war hammer swings, a blur of obsidian that connects with
the first zombie’s shoulder. There is a flash of radiance, a dry snap,
and the creature’s arm slumps, hanging limply from decayed sinew.
“Gross!” Kragor barks.</p>
<p>Scarlet raises her staff, ready to unleash the fury of the earth
should the dead things get any closer. Doctor Pepe snaps a bolt into his
crossbow. He fires. The bolt screams past Kragor’s ear and ricochets off
the ceiling with a sharp <em>“ping”</em>. The rogue melts back into the
relative safety of the lab.</p>
<p>The first zombie, one arm useless, swings its good one in a clumsy
arc that Kragor easily sidesteps. The second lurches forward, its own
wild blow glancing harmlessly off the orc’s armor.</p>
<p>Gerhard steps up to the doorway, his bow already drawn. <em>“Mors
certa!”</em> he cries, and the arcane mark flares on the second zombie.
The arrow strikes true, punching through the creature’s chest. The thing
stumbles but does not fall.</p>
<p>It is Elara’s arrow that finishes it. Her shot is clean, precise, and
the second zombie collapses into a heap of robes, bones, and rotted
flesh. Kragor, seeing his chance, chants <em>“Te exsecro”</em> as his
eyes glow with a sickly green light. Suddenly, chartreuse arcs of light
dance like smoke around the first zombie. Another swing of his war
hammer, and the creature’s head separates from its shoulders, its unlife
violently extinguished in an incandescent explosion.</p>
<p>And then, in the eerie silence, the fallen corpse of the zombie
brought down by Gerhard’s and Elara’s arrows begins to stir. Bone knits
to bone, and it rises again.</p>
<h2 id="the-mountains-breath">The Mountain’s Breath</h2>
<p>Miles away, Halite and Whisper approach the source of the steam
plume. It billows from a ten-foot gap in the mountainside, a constant,
ghostly exhalation.</p>
<p>“The mountain’s breathing,” Halite rumbles, his voice low with
awe.</p>
<p>Whisper’s tail gives a single, decisive flick. “Let’s see if it has
anything interesting to say.”</p>
<p>The air near the opening is surprisingly warm, a welcome respite from
Foren’s bite, but the thick, rolling vapor forms an impenetrable
wall.</p>
<p>“Can’t see a damn thing,” Halite states, peering into the white
abyss. “But it’s warm. Too warm.”</p>
<p>“Better than freezing,” Whisper counters, already uncoiling a rope
from her pack. “Give me your javelin.” It isn’t a question.</p>
<p>Halite grunts his approval. “Right. Sound thinking.”</p>
<p>Whisper ties the rope fast, and returns it to Halite. With a grunt,
he hurls the weapon into the mist. It clatters on stone maybe thirty
feet in. As he begins reeling it back, he feels a new resistance pull at
the line. The javelin emerges coated in warm water that freezes almost
instantly into a sheath of cloudy ice.</p>
<p>“Hot spring?” Halite queries, chipping the ice away with a gauntleted
thumb.</p>
<p>“Or a bath for something very large and very angry,” Whisper muses,
her eyes gleaming. “Tying in. You first, or me?”</p>
<p>Before he can answer, she secures the rope around her waist and his,
then creeps forward. After a few paces, her next step finds no purchase.
She lurches, her paw plunging into water before she catches herself with
a soft hiss. The water is warm, smelling faintly of sulfur.</p>
<p>“Definitely a spring,” she calls back, her voice slightly muffled.
“And I’m not getting my gear soaked. Going in.” She quickly sheds her
equipment, her natural inclination for warmth overriding any caution.
The water is chest-deep, and as she steps in, the accumulated stress of
their long journey begins to melt from her bones. A gentle current pulls
from her left. She wades against it until her hands meet the far stone
wall of the large pool. The steam is thinner here, and she sees a
narrow, furiously hot stream feeding the pool from an opening in the
rock.</p>
<p>She climbs out onto a dry ledge just as Halite wades through to join
her, the water only reaching his waist. For a moment, they are eye to
eye, the goliath in the pool and the tabaxi on the ledge, surrounded by
the mountain’s warmth.</p>
<p>“Alright, you’ve had your spa day,” Halite says, a hint of a smile in
his voice. “What’s next?”</p>
<p>Whisper points a single, sharp claw toward a bright orange glow
visible from the passage upstream.</p>
<p>“That,” she says. “That’s next.”</p>
<p>They follow the steaming, three-foot-wide stream into a vast cavern.
A couple of walls here are not natural stone, but perfectly flat,
polished marble. And in the center of the cavern, floating in absolute
silence, is a massive, misty-blue, nearly transparent sphere.</p>
<p>Within the sphere floats a cage of shimmering electrum, its form a
perfect, intricate dodecahedron. And inside the cage, suspended in
absolute stillness, stands a giant figure made of flame. Its fiery
tendrils are frozen, a silent, eternal inferno.</p>
<p>“What in the Ashkeeper’s crumbling peak is that?” Halite breathes,
the words a cloud in the humid air.</p>
<p>“It’s a dodecahedron,” Whisper observes, her voice a low purr of
intense focus. “And inside… a genie? An elemental? Whatever it is, it’s
not moving.” Her tail twitches with a mixture of curiosity and
caution.</p>
<p>They jump the narrow, steaming stream to get a closer look. Against a
polished wall surface stands a strange table that seems to grow directly
from the wall itself.</p>
<p>“This wall… it’s impossibly smooth. Unclimbable!” Whisper complains,
running her claws over the seamless marble. They find no purchase.</p>
<p>“But what craftsmanship,” Halite murmurs, running a gauntleted hand
over the table. “No seams, no tool marks. It’s like it was sliced from
the mountain with a vorpal sword.”</p>
<p>On the table, a small light glows a steady azure at one end, while a
simple lever rests at the other. Strange, flowing script is carved into
the marble before each. Neither Halite nor Whisper can make sense of
it.</p>
<p>Whisper’s unquenchable curiosity wins. With a confident movement of
her wrist, she pulls the lever.</p>
<p>“Are you sure that’s a good idea!?” Halite bellows, startled.</p>
<p>The azure light on the table blinks off. Then it blinks red once,
twice, then winks out. The azure light returns, glowing steadily once
more. Nothing else seems to happen. The caged flame remains perfectly
still.</p>
<p>“Well, that was anticlimactic,” Whisper says with a shrug, and pulls
the lever again. Again, the light switches from azure to two red blinks,
then back.</p>
<p>Halite grimaces at her. “You and your levers.” He crouches down,
running his hands over the strange table, looking for any other clues.
Underneath, his fingers brush against a small, corked bottle. He pulls
it out. A golden metal filigree, adorned with strange writing, wraps
around a glass core. Within the bottle, something blue and iridescent
swirls like a captured galaxy.</p>
<p>“Ooh, shiny,” Whisper coos, leaning over his shoulder.</p>
<p>“And probably cursed,” Halite grunts, stashing it securely in his
backpack. “It stays there until we find someone who doesn’t poke at
things for fun.”</p>
<p>He turns back to study the motionless figure of flame. The longer he
stares at its massive, frozen form, the smaller and more insignificant
he feels. He notices then that the sphere seems to be set directly
against the marble wall, and the hot stream originates from that exact
spot.</p>
<p>He moves to investigate more closely, his boot slipping on the damp
floor. He trips, throwing out a hand to steady himself. His palm slaps
against the blue sphere. It doesn’t yield. It feels more solid than the
mountain itself.</p>
<p>Now that he is closer, he sees the detail he couldn’t make out from
across the room. On this side, near the floor, the electrum cage is
warped, a few of its bars bent outward. Through that gap, the fiery
figure’s back heel protrudes, just barely breaking the surface of the
sphere. There, and only there, the flames are active, licking and
dancing as they meet the constant flow of snowmelt from a fissure in the
rock, creating the intensely hot stream of water that warms the entire
cavern.</p>
<p>“Whisper,” Halite says, his voice low. “Get over here. You need to
see this.” He points. “The whole hot spring… it’s just runoff from a
prisoner’s leaky cell.”</p>
<p>They explore the rest of the vast cavern, but find nothing further of
note. The silent, flaming giant in its blue prison remains the sole,
baffling mystery.</p>
<p>“Think we could break it out?” Whisper asks, tapping a claw against
the unyielding blue sphere. The sound is a dull, dead thud.</p>
<p>“And unleash <em>that</em>?” Halite rumbles, gesturing to the silent
inferno. “I’d rather not be the one to thaw out whatever it is. It was
put in here for a reason.”</p>
<p><img src="elemental_cavern.jpg" /></p>
<p>“But what reason?” she muses, her tail lashing with thought. “A power
source? A guardian? An eternal punishment?” She trots back to the
console. “Maybe if I try the lever just one more time…”</p>
<p>“Don’t you dare,” Halite warns, his voice flat. “We have no idea what
this is. For all we know, that thing is counting the red flashes and
waiting for the right number to break free and turn us into
cinders.”</p>
<p>Whisper sighs theatrically. “You’re no fun.” She makes one last
circuit of the room, running her claws fruitlessly against the seamless
marble walls, while Halite gives the sphere a wide berth. His gaze fixes
on the frozen, fiery giant. The sheer scale of it is humbling.</p>
<p>Having exhausted their curiosity for the moment, their thoughts turn
back to the rest of their party and their quest.</p>
<p>“Alright,” Halite says, turning his back on the prisoner. “We’ve seen
the mountain’s furnace. There’s nothing more for us here. Let’s go find
the others. Knowing Kragor, he’s probably charged headfirst into a wall
by now.”</p>
<p>Whisper casts one last, longing look at the sphere. “Fine. But we’re
coming back here.”</p>
<p>They wade back through the warm pool, the shock of Foren’s cold air
hitting them like a physical blow as they emerge from the steam.
Shivering, they return the way they came, their snowshoes crunching in
the snow as they head back toward Salsvault.</p>
<h2 id="the-unending-tide">The Unending Tide</h2>
<p>Back inside, Scarlet recites <em>“Ignis vagus”</em> and her hand
flashes. A mote of fire leaps from her palm and engulfs the re-risen
zombie, which collapses once more into a smoldering pile. Doctor Pepe,
peeking from his hiding place, targets one of the remaining zombies, but
his crossbow misfires. “Raven Queen’s beak!” he spits.</p>
<p>A third zombie reaches Kragor. It brings both fists down on the orc,
who shrugs it off with fiendish vigor. The magical frost of his armor
lashes out, and the creature recoils, its own fists pierced by ice. The
fourth closes in, but its attack is clumsy, glancing off Kragor’s
armor.</p>
<p>“There are more of them!” Gerhard yells, peering down the long hall
and spotting a fifth and a sixth walking corpse. He marks the fourth
zombie and sends an arrow into its neck, leaving a terrible wound.</p>
<p>At that moment, Halite and Whisper arrive at the entrance to
Salsvault. Hearing the sounds of battle, Halite unslings his trident and
enters without a word. Whisper is a blur of motion behind him. She
streaks past the party, into the hallway, a creature of pure, fluid
speed. She leaps onto the fourth zombie, grappling it. In a flash, her
claws rend the restrained corpse. It falls, then immediately begins to
knit itself back together. A second slash from her claws tears it apart
again, and this time, it stays down.</p>
<p>Elara’s voice rings out, <em>“Sidereus lumen!”</em>, and a mote of
starlight flies from her hand, striking the third zombie. It shudders.
Kragor follows with a final, crunching blow from his hammer. A blazing
corona of light erupts from the hammer to consume the third zombie’s
head. It does not get back up; it simply ceases to be.</p>
<p>Scarlet hurls another flame down the hall, striking a fifth zombie
that has just shambled into view. Doctor Pepe, giving up on his
crossbow, rushes forward, dagger and shortsword in hand. He fumbles his
first strike but connects with his second. Halite, now in the hallway,
takes aim and throws his trident. It passes clean through the zombie,
pinning it to the floor. It, too, falls apart.</p>
<p>The sixth and final zombie lumbers forward, swinging at Doctor Pepe,
who skillfully evades the blow.</p>
<p>Gerhard marks it, but his arrow zips past the ears of both rogue and
zombie. As Whisper moves to engage, her foot tangles in Gerhard’s
discarded, broken bowstring. She trips, falling prone with a curse. She
rights herself in an instant, lashing out with her claws. Two quick
strikes leave the final zombie reeling.</p>
<p>Elara ends it. Another wisp of starlight, another flash of radiant
energy, and the last of the undead guardians is utterly destroyed.</p>
<p>Silence, thick and heavy, falls over the corridor.</p>
<p>Doctor Pepe and Halite creep to the end of the hall, peering around
the corner. More doors. More of Salsvault’s sterile, silent mystery.</p>
<p>As the others catch their breath, Kragor inspects one of the fallen
zombie’s robes. “Strange,” he says, rubbing the material between his
fingers. “It’s like plant fiber, but… not. And it’s not rotted at all.
For being nine hundred years old, it’s in perfect shape.”</p>
<p>“Waste not,” Whisper says, already pulling one of the robes over her
own clothes. Kragor and Gerhard follow suit, the strange, ancient
garments settling over their armor.</p>
<h2 id="an-unexpected-sanctuary">An Unexpected Sanctuary</h2>
<p>The reunited party gathers in the entryway.</p>
<p>“You missed a hell of a thing,” Halite says, his voice low with awe.
He and Whisper describe the cavern, the marble walls, the massive blue
sphere, and the flame prisoner. Halite then produces the bottle. “And we
found this under the strange table.”</p>
<p>Doctor Pepe takes it, turning it over in his hands. “I can’t read
this… it’s Draconic, like the script on the walls, but … it’s not
<em>words</em>.” He pauses for a moment, recalling a memory. “But I
remember an old wizard telling me that Draconic is a common language for
spell scrolls.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps the writing itself is part of the enchantment,” Elara
suggests.</p>
<p>“Whatever it is,” Scarlet says, looking from one exhausted face to
another, “that warm cavern you found sounds like the perfect place to
rest. We’re no good to anyone if we collapse in here.”</p>
<p>The party quickly reaches a consensus. They leave Salsvault the way
they came, strap their snowshoes back on, and trudge across the snow and
up the mountainside to the cavern’s steamy entrance. Kragor carefully
unstraps the massive dragon egg from his back, leaving it just outside.
“Don’t want the little one to cook,” he mutters.</p>
<p>Inside, the warmth is a welcome shock. The air is humid, filled with
the gentle sound of the stream. They settle near the great blue sphere,
its silent presence both unnerving and strangely calming.</p>
<p>Scarlet frowns. “The elemental planes are places of pure creation.
Sometimes, when a piece of one bleeds into our world, it brings its
nature with it. That creature in the sphere… it’s a fire elemental. A
powerful one, to heat this much water.”</p>
<p>Doctor Pepe examines the small console table near the sphere. He runs
a finger under the script. “Here,” he says. “Next to the lever, it says
<em>Power Interrupt</em>. And this script, by the light? <em>Energy
Regnum Only</em>.”</p>
<p>“A trap… or a prison,” Halite rumbles, staring at the still, flaming
figure within the cage, within the sphere. “And we’re sleeping in the
warden’s office.”</p>
<p>As Kragor lies down on the smooth marble floor, he feels it—a low,
rhythmic humming vibrating up through the stone. “Anyone else feel
that?”</p>
<p>Watches are set. Halite takes the first, Scarlet the second. The
humming continues, a deep, resonant pulse beneath them, but nothing
disturbs their rest. For the first time in what feels like an eternity,
they sleep soundly, warmed by the impossible heat of a caged, primordial
fire. Morning finds them rested, healed, and ready to face the sunken
secrets of Salsvault once more.</p>
